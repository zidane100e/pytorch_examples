0,"the entrance was the impressive thing about this place , as it is completely a surprise and almost shocks you . i won t give it up here but it s worth at least getting a drink to experience that part . n ngreeter was great . n nlounge singer was very s and campy , but liked him none the less . n n nfood is pretty below average in pretty much every way possible . n nbread they bring out is pretty bad and dries out within minutes of being at the table to the point it s inedible . n nsalads were small , boring and way drowned in dressing . n ncalamari is or so , and is half the size of what they d give you at capitol grille , and is pretty bland and mushy . n nthe pasta tasted as though it were cooked in rancid water . the chef was nice enough to come out and bring my wife a personalized dish that he eats , and it tasted the same . we smiled and pretended to enjoy it just to keep from looking like big complainers . we literally don t complain usually , but her first dish was inedible . n nmy lasagna was decent , but nothing spectacular and the sauce was too sweet but that s a matter of taste , so i digress . n ndesert it was spectacular . try the tiramisu , it is the best i ve ever had . canolis were great too . loved it . n nour server was new , and he told us as such , so he was pretty clueless overall , but very nice as well . n nbus boys were very attentive . n nservice overall was above average but the food was just so mediocre i can t think of a reason to talk myself into visiting again . n nif you go , get a drink , maybe an app , and head somewhere else for a good italian dinner . for god s sake , maggianos a chain kills this place at the same price point . you re better of there or macaroni grill truthfully .

0,"i m a mclover , and i had no problem nwith the workers . but i have a problem waiting more than minutes for my cheeseburger . they weren t even busy ! this was my first and last time at this location . "
0,"less than good here , not terrible , but i see no reason to come back . n nchicken yakisoba was really boring . the chicken had zero flavor , it didn t taste seasoned at all or marinated . it tasted like a plain grilled chicken thigh . the noodles were lifeless , no flavor and mushy . the dish had no flavor . it was noodles , veg and chicken but nothing else . n nordered an egg roll , it was mushy . one bite and that was it . n nalso , i guy in wheel chair had no place to sit . this place has rows of booths and no place for a wheel chair . a little inconsiderate . "
0,"i don t know if i can ever bring myself to go back to this place . i had to pick up some supplies the other day for some ongoing health issues i ve been having . i d only ever been into the store once before , so i was just walking around trying to familiarize myself with everything so that i finally knew where to look for what i was looking for . at one point an employee walked up to me and said you have been here forever ! ! ! ! i d really only been there for about minutes , but maybe she could have said it like it wasn t an inconvenience that i d been there for a few minutes . i said i m just looking for a few things and i don t really know what i m looking for . i had a list with me from my doctor , so i told the woman what my doctor had suggested . she asked me and what health problems are you having ? . . . that was a very personal question that if i hadn t been okay talking to another woman about , i would have just told her to mind her own business . . . . but hoping that the more detail i gave her , the better she d be able to help me , i told her what unpleasant things i had been experiencing . she then looked at me with a disgusted look . . . . great , exactly what i was hoping she wouldn t do . she started handing me all these vitamins and supplements . . . that were not what my doctor was telling me about . so i said i m just looking for these few things and she said well it looks like this is the aisle you want to be in . here s another supplement as she handed me yet another bottle . i said what does this do ? and she said i don t know , but it s the berry from the same tree as that thing in your hand that your doctor suggested . i don t even know what that s for . i thanked her , told her i found what i was looking for , and when she left me , i put literally everything back that she had handed me because there was no way i was going to buy all this unwanted unneeded crap . as it was , i walked out of there after spending . i know vitamin shops can be expensive , but if i m going to spend on herbal remedies , they should at least pretend like my health problems aren t totally disgusting .

0,"food was ok good but the service was terrible . fries came out cold but sandwiches were warm and good n nwe were repeatedly ignored by multiple members of the wait staff . there were open tables in sight so it was clearly not rush hour . our appetizers never came out so i cancelled them when our entrees came . waiter seemed be hiding from us as we could never find him to order drinks , appetizer , or ketchup . i eventually walked to another section of the restaurant to find another waiter who happily and rapidly got us drinks and ketchup . the two runners who brought us waters and our entrees said they would bring us drinks and appetizers , but were never seen from again n ni would never eat here again . "
0,"we had high expectations based on the yelp reviews , but was disappointed on the overall conditions of the grounds around the two restaurants and the maya farm . the maya firm was an actual pit , with weeds , mud , and huts in shambles . the chicken coop was in poor shape w animals drinking out of green water . the morning glory cafe was good . . . great attentive service and the food was excellent . but , the amount of flies made it unbearable to eat , and sitting on those white plastic chairs wasn t that cool . and , the grounds were just run down and really not ready for the public . a real gold mine , if the owners would invest in updating and cleaning up their property . hopefully , they will . "
0,"this was my second stay to the hotel . i loved the suites last year and thought it was a first rate hotel . my experience the second time was very disappointing . the suites are terrific here , but the service has fallen off and is certainly not star quality . the pool is quite a hike from the hotel and is used by mandalay bay guests , so it is extremely crowded . if you want to use the bathhouse spa , which i enjoyed very much last year , be sure to book far in advance . on this most recent stay , which was a last minute booking , there were no spa appointments available for the days that i was there . there was lots of waiting a customer service snaffus and although management was available to speak with , nothing was done to compensate for all of the issues . very disappointing . vegas has lots of rooms and i will certainly try somewhere else next visit . sorry , the hotel , you had me at hello , but lost me the second time around ! ! "
0,"we went there for our anniversary . i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service . however , the food was not at what we expected at all ! we ordered the shrimp rolls which looked like there was shrimp in the roll but they cut it into what it looked like thirds or halves to make it look like there was more shrimp than there actually was . also the rice paper kinda grossed us out . we had never had it before , it was very rubbery . our entrees came out and my pasta was very bland and the orange chicken was something we could have made at home . our drinks and cheesecake were the best part of our whole dinner . we were disappointed because we were hoping for a nice dinner for our anniversary . "
0,"the only reason i got to edc within hours instead of is because i ran . miles there after my bus broke down . spent the whole night being sweaty and exhausted . never , ever , ever go with these guys . "
0,dont waste ur time poor service . . . wrong food order . . . bad food n . . never again for me
0,this place is decked out and beautiful . . . . as for the service . . . you must make reservations prior to entering or else you will get kicked out in the middle of your experience if that room was already booked prior to you booking it . would that be considered bad service or proper service ? 
0,"this place gets the award for worst experience in vegas ! we were on the guest list and waiting at least an hour to get in . we waiting and waited and watched group after group of skinny white girls get in . when we asked about how long , we were told repeatedly one second . it wasn t until i finally asked if we were wasting our time did we get in . i don t mind waiting my turn , but when it s my turn i d like to take it . n nonce inside it was basically a fire hazard with so many people . you couldn t move , you couldn t dance and you couldn t get to the bar . n nevery staff person we encountered was pretty much rude . n ni wouldn t waste your time here when there are so many clubs to choose from . "
0,"worst dunkin donuts in existence . tried it times now and each time rude staff , drinks not worth me paying a penny for , and the donuts aren t anywhere near the same tasting as the rest of the locations . i d be scared to know health department score for this establishment , because i ve gotten sick everytime . if it weren t for the location , i never would ve gone back after try one . i assure you i ll never go back at all ever . corporate dunkin needs to look into this location because the quality and service ruins the entire business reputation . don t go here ! "
0,"my husband is a burger guy and despite our last two awful experiences at this location he talked me into giving in one last try . it s been two years since our last visit so i was hoping it had improved couldn t get much worse , but boy was i wrong . went there today thur about pm . min later the waiter took our drink order . we ordered an appetizer which never did arrive even after we reminded our server . our mo old was getting fussy so we asked for a small plate of french fries , which also , never arrived . min later our food arrived and once again , just like before , it was cold . i ordered a hot prime rib sandwich . ridic ! my daughters grilled cheese was blah with unmelted cheese , fries were cold , and my entree was missing the coleslaw . i politely requested it again , but it too was elusive . they took my sandwich back to the kitchen and nuked it . seriously i cannot say one good thing about the quality of the food or service . truth is , i will tolerate sub par service for a good meal , but everything from the iced tea to my stale bread and the undercooked and tasteless steak fries was beyond disappointing . our toddler even refused the fries and he eats everything ! ! we spoke with manager after paying and she offered a comp . umm no thanks but greatly appreciate the gesture . the mgr was a sweetheart and admitted our server was normally a bus boy but they got so busy they had to have him serve . a scheduling problem maybe ? anyway it just couldn t make up for the awful food . i would avoid this rr . we can t make sense of the good reviews . only thing i can think of is its young people who are happy to get a meal from somewhere other than wendy s . personally , i d rather have wendy s .

0,currently it is raining . everytime it does rain i lose the connection . i pay over a . for this service and it really does not deliver . i am going to obtain a digital antenae . i can t believe they actually charge people for this poor service . a set of rabbit ears with aluminum foil would work better than this piece of crap . ndo not consider buying this . . . . n n n b
0,"good food , poor service n stars for food , minus three for service because there was none . food was authentic , especially considering the restaurant was part of the palms coffee shop . nour waiter was cold and absolutely paid no attention to us . never return after taking orders and placing orders on table . nthe bus person was good and helpful . since we were going to a show after dinner , so we waited and waited for our check , finally had to ask another waiter for it while our waiter was cleaning table and just ignored us while we signaled for our checks several times . nit is a shame , we been to other restaurants at the palms , service this time was the worst . ntoo bad , the waiter never bother to introduce himself , otherwise would have complained to management . may be he had good reason for not letting patrons knowing his name . nthe waiter was wearing glasses . "
0,"the room was quite nice , but the douchey clientele and the reality show jackassery being filmed which forced all in the cab line to wait extra minutes to get a cab when we had dinner and or show reservations waiting were very uncool . n nalso , cab rides to from the strip ended up making this stay cost aboutt as much or more than just staying on the strip in a comparable spot . "
0,"nice decor in the casino , cool concepts , kind of an alice in wonderland meets wizard of oz . . i think the carpets are neat , better than the lame ass carpets at the usual casinos . life nightclub is my favorite local spot now , friendly staff , buffet was on point . umami burger is horrible , rooms are nice except there s no sheets on the beds , and there s weird french printed drapes on the walls that give it a cheap feel . in the suites and garage elevators didn t work . n nforgot to add , there was no closets , and safe wasn t even prepped we had to call somebody to bring a screwdriver to unscrew the battery door to put the batteries in . was on hold for a long time . hard to get ahold of anybody . n nour favorite spot is cosmo . always perfect service and nice rooms . "
0,"another mediocre indian restaurant , mediocre food , mediocre service at mediocre prices . some days can be less than mediocre . if you re craving some specific dish , and your drew lots for this , i guess it s okay . i am not sure anyone would choose to go here . nmeh ! "
0,"this place recently came to mt . leb and it immediately hopped on my eat here list . i went with my guy after a heavy night of adult beverages and we needed greasy food asap . nforemost , the set up of the restaurant is awful . we walked in to the store to the grill line and some bar stool seating no alcohol involved . we tried to order there , but were sent back to the dining area . nour waitress was young and very slow . she didn t make much of an effort to connect with us or help us order , even though we told her it was our first time there . we ordered chili cheese fries from the menu as an appetizer of course , they came with our main course . ntim and i both ordered custom burgers from the burgatory esque menu pads . the toppings that were available were extensive specialty items avocado , smokehouse onion cheddar cheese , season your own burger ? why don t you have seasoned meat , bndz ? our mto burgers were tasty , but nothing special . . . even with the added specialty toppings . they were both over cooked . nthe dining clientele itself was very interesting . one woman knocked over her glass of pepsi and her waitress took a total of minutes to clean it up with paper towels , no rag or mop . n nnothing made sense about this place .

0,"been here twice in the past week , each time ordering unsweet tea and each time getting sweet only to realize this when i m back in the car ! n nthere are always lines here and there s no drive thru i love you , dd , but this location is a pain and i don t think i ll be coming back . n nfor the record , this hurts me more than it hurts you .

0,"well , this is how i first felt when i got my food food on styrofoam plates and cups ? seriously ? i feel guilty to spoil mother earth with so much plastic shit ! the food is not cheap , why cannot they serve food on the proper plates and cups ? i guess it was not a good day to go to woodlands for us , we ordered masala dosa , idli and vada combo . dosa was only cooked one side and when i told the lady about it she told me something ridiculous thinking i do not know how to make dosa myself . and idlis were not bad but vada had that stale oily smell . you know what i mean right ? ? my hubby ordered bisibelebath his all time fav which was not bisi means hot at all . it was cold . i am never ever going to this place . all you green lovers out there , i highly recommend avoiding this place to avoid seeing so much plastic plates , cups , spoons , forks . . etc . and believe me the prices are comparable to other indian restaurants out there . its a bummer that it is so bad . me being a vegetarian , i will have one less place to choose .

0,service is always bad . management not friendly . 
0,"well , that was a big disappointment . n napparently vegas is not as accommodating as you think . n nfrequenters of las vegas tell me your thoughts n n hello , n nmy name is krista mckenna and i am currently looking to book a return trip for my sister sara mckenna and i with new comers at aria for a bachelorette party in september ideal dates are sept . there will be of us in our group , and since i loved my experience at aria this past may we had a day stay at aria , i wanted to share this experience with of my best friends . n nour problem is this everywhere i go , including your website , i cant seem to find a comparable deal flight out of bellingham , limo transport to hotel , or large rooms for our group , and return trip at a decent value or package . n nbecause of such , the other ladies in our group are becoming hesitant in staying at aria since everywhere we look , it doesn t provide a package deal price and utility wise thats competitive enough with the other hotels on the strip . n ni , personally , am really rooting for aria for the win . why ? because i believe that aria obtains the atmosphere , vibe and experience my friends deserve for their first trip to vegas . liquid is amazing , your pools are gorgeous , your food is delicious love the gluten free options ! , staff is friendly and your rooms hotel are stunning . after personally experiencing such calibre , i don t trust in testing other hotels and would prefer to make aria my go to for all things vegas . my family also feels the same as my father has become a loyal customer to aria for his last visits to vegas an mlife card holder , so i would like to make it our family s go to vegas choice . n nour price range per person for room , hotel utilities pool , gym , internet and including flights is each , not including food or drink , or shows gambling which we also plan on doing a lot of , totalling for our group purely for accommodation and airfare . n ncan aria meet the need ? if yes , what can aria offer that meets that need ? n ni know that the other girls in our group have never experienced vegas before , and i know that depending on this stay , they will most likely become regulars to the vegas and hopefully aria experience . n nside note i have also obtained a significant amount of loyalty chips on the facebook app myvegas , and qualify for perks at aria i intend to use this as well towards our stay at aria if possible , and i have encouraged the rest of our party to do the same . n nso where do we go from here ? n nplease let me know what aria can offer i am eager to book this trip and anticipate another amazing stay with aria for my family and friends . n nwishing you the best , nkrista mckenna n social architect buzz generator n nco founder executive director n nnot bad right ? n nsince i have worked in the service industry for years , i know that an email like this isn t very common . typically , based on expectations of a certain caliber of customer service , you would expect a response that is both somewhat accommodating and flexible . n nafter all vegas has a reputation of being a fun , financially feasible and lets face it , cheap with free perks place to vacation . n n . . . nwhat i got back in response n n good morning krista , n nthank you for your interest in mgm resorts vacations for your upcoming trip to las vegas . we are so pleased to hear of your recent pleasant experience at the aria . n ni have sent you a separate price quote for a party of six to this email address . prices and inventory are subject to change at a moment s notice . you can plan , price and book your air with the aria anytime on our website at www . mgmresortsvacations . com . n ni do apologize for any confusion however , we do not have access to your mlife account . i recommend your contacting them directly . also , the points you mention earning would have to go thru the property directly as they cannot be applied to a vacation package . n nbesides our website , price quotes are also available through our customer care center at . . , monday friday am pm and saturday am pm and sunday p p , et . n nplease call for assistance . we look forward to hearing from you ! n nsincerely , n n ninternet customer care nmgm resorts vacations n n no email received . n nis that even a response ? why do i feel like they didn t even read my email questions ? why would you even bother responding if above is all your going to say ? n nnot going to lie , im pretty disappointed in aria resort casino and mgm resorts international public relations . n ncompletely takes away any interest or motivation on going to the strip , and on building loyalty with one specific hotel . n nim open to your thoughts , friends . tell me what you think . was i holding too high and or unrealistic expectations ? n n note i have still yet to hear back from the pr team customer service sector regarding this .

0,"lange wartezeiten , schlechter service . eine halbe stunde an der theke gewartet , bis ein tisch frei wird , es wurden mehrere frei , die waren aber angeblich alle reserviert , obwohl leute , die neben uns an der theke waren und nicht reserviert hatten , einen tisch bekommen haben . der kleine lustige italiener , der bediente , hat es einfach nicht drauf . nburger ok , nichts besonderes . f u fcr diese qualit u e t ist der preis eindeutig zu hoch , lieber im diner im zkm oder im american diner in durlach burgers essen gehen . . .

0,"don t ever make this mistake . i currently live here , and after the maintenance technician finally used the last straw that broke the camel s back i am here to put forth the reasons not to live at renaissance apartments . n n hour maintenance for emergencies is what they advertise , unless it s inconvenient . the repairman decided that we don t need air conditioning it is degrees right now until tomorrow . we have lived without a c for a full day now , and will surely enjoy our long night s sleep . his excuse is that he has to go get a ladder and that will have to wait until tomorrow . apparently for a one bedroom isn t enough money to convince the landlord to hire a maintenance technician who actually does his job . instead , he threatened to fine me if i try to fix it myself . n nthe dog park they advertise is actually a walled off area with gravel , where teenagers hang out to smoke weed throughout the night . n nexpect a poorly built bathroom . it will look great when you move in , but it takes less than a month for the cheap caulking they use to peel away , which in turn will cause disgusting stains that can t be removed . n nyou have better options than renaissance apartments .

0,"i visited mimi s cafe this past friday as part of a supper club group that meets at different restaurants once a week . so keeping in mind we had a larger party , i have to say i was not super impressed . ni ordered the asparagus and brie quiche . was told a few minutes later that they were out of it , so i settled on the quattro fromage quiche instead . this is listed as one of their newer menu items . none of my fellow diners got a salad which came with a huge blueberry muffin . this thing was enormous . we already had baskets of bread on the table , so it was a bit confusing why the salad came with a muffin , but apparently muffins are kind of their thing . anyway , this thing was very filling . we all had a taste of it and there was still some left over . a very cake y texture , and heavy . nnext , the soup that came with my quiche came out . i had the daily special , chicken gumbo . i was pretty disappointed in the soup . it was a very small toureen of soup and there were huge hunks of celery and small bites of chicken in a pretty bland , thick broth . i m not a big fan of celery , and i know places use it as an inexpensive filler vegetable , but the celery to soup ratio was kind of off considering what a small portion of soup you got . n nthe quiche was ok . the crust was plain and did not taste as though it was freshly made more like they came pre prepared and were just filled with whatever at the restaurant . also , it was supposed to have sundried tomatoes in it , and i found two very small hunks of tomato in mine . for a quiche that was nearly across , that was disappointing . also , for a quiche that was named quattro fromage , the cheese flavor was sadly lacking . n nfor the next part of my review i will offer a qualification . i am not sure if mimi s is intended for kids or not . they do have a nice kids menu so i assume it s not uncommon for people to bring kids . that said , my kids meals were a bit of a surprise . my one kid had applesauce as a side and i had to request a spoon just so he could eat it . he also had spaghetti with marinara sauce which was lukewarm at best . my other kid ordered mini corn dogs , and i had to request ketchup for him as well since it isn t provided on the table . also , if you opt for the fruit as a side on the kids meal , it comes with the rinds still attached pineapple , honeydew , and orange slices . i was a bit surprised by that . finally , their meals came with a dirt cup dessert that i thought was super cute chocolate pudding , oreo cookie crumbles on top , and two gummy worms sticking out . i thought this would be right up my kids alley , but they didn t like it and neither finished their dessert . kind of strange for a and year old boys to not eat dessert ! n nfinally , i will comment on the server herself . i realise she had a bit of a hard time because their dining room is not laid out very well . since there were larger people groups , she had to go all the way around three large tables to get from one end of our group to the other , as our table was up against the wall . however , i do think she could have at least tried to bus our table as we finished with things . our table was crowded with dirty dishes we were through with that nobody ever took away . my water glass was also empty for much of my meal , which is a pet peeve of mine . n nwhen all is said and done , mimi s may have fared better had they not been located across from northlake mall . unfortunately , there are just too many good dining options at the mall for me to honestly say i would opt to eat here again . i m glad i gave it a try , but i was not impressed .

0,this was a little disappointing . the observation deck was really small . we waited minutes in line and stayed maybe minutes . it was really cold . at night you can see the water show at the bellagio . i thought the stratosphere was much better . it was bigger and comfortable . 
0,"wow . what a treat . i haven t even tried the food but i ll write a review based on the delivery . i ordered off grubhub and while it is a bit late in the evening about pm it was not ridiculously late . plus , it was still three hours before the store s posted closing hours . they showed up , about minutes before the estimated time yay . but were extremely rude on the phone when they got here sign . look , i had a really freaking bad night tonight . i had to put my cat down and i don t want to deal with anything at all . i just want pizza . i tipped well over on my credit card . i just want pizza delivered with no fuss . the delivery guy literally throws shoves my order into my face , part of it falls onto the floor and he just walks away . says nothing other than ok and walks away . i tipped over for that ? ? maybe i am just oversensitive given my night s events , but i am livid . it really is upsetting to me and i will never order from them again . "
0,"i really want to like this place . i do . the decor has got the hip modern restaurant in a house thing like the main ingredient , only it s more open and had no trouble accommodating our group of eleven we had made a reservation . they have cucumber water , which is awesome and for the most part , everyone s dishes looked good from where i sat . nmy disappointment came when it was my turn to order . i was informed that they don t really modify dishes because they are going for a specific style and flavor . i worked in restaurants for years . trust me , i get it . you don t want me to modify the heck out of something then say i don t like it . but unfortunately , i have some medical issues that make it difficult for me to digest more than trivial amounts of fats . i was informed by our server , south , that i couldn t even get the dressing on the side for a salad . they don t even have a regular grilled chicken breast . i asked for his recommendations and the only thing that sounded remotely healthy was the vegetarian gnocchi the regular has sausage and i asked for it with very , very little oil in the pan . nso , our food arrived and everything looked great . my boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese and said it was good . then the gnocchi arrived . with a puddle of oil in the bottom . then my friend s dish arrived to my left . lo and behold , there were grilled vegetables on the plate with what looked like oil on them , but even that would have been better . why not just offer a side of grilled vegetables ? how hard is it to do things a la carte ? nnot being one to complain or send things back , i ate what i could of the gnocchi , pulling pieces off of the main dish and putting them on one of their share plates so i could pat the oil off of them before eating them . about a half an hour later , i began to feel ill . ni know i could have been a jerk , made a big stink , asked for the manager , etc but why ruin everyone else s good time ? i ve been a restaurant manager , i hated getting yelled at because one of my servers was pretentious and entitled and was too lazy to see what the kitchen could do . nso , if you don t have any special dietary needs and you like to be treated like you don t know what you re talking about , go to tuck shop . otherwise , i ll stick with the main ingredient and ask for a slice of cucumber in my water . at least they put dressing on the side . "
0,"interestingly , we had great anticipation for a great dinner . sadly , we had a server who was so aggressive that it really undermined the experience . she was more suited to be the person you encounter at a car wash asking if you want your windshield fixed , your car waxed , your interior lathered . . . it was really annoying . i love cartwright s so we will give them another try and we had a wonderful experience at tonto b g earlier in the day . let s just remember the goal of creating a great customer experience . "
0,"kind of odd when reviewers have zero friends but give this place stars . . hmmm . . nso i brought my two dogs here for self wash and was not impressed . dirty facility , stained towels , and the groomer was taking really mean to a dog she was grooming he was a bit of a whiner but i don t think yelling at him or telling him shut up is the answer . . i don t talk to my dogs that way not would i be cool w anyone else doing that ! . also the owner was showing me how to use the dryer fyi i ve done dog rescue for years and he was holding my dog by her arm under her shoulder and she looked in pain so i told him stop . . then he goes on and on about how the owners need training too , to be firm w their dogs . umm , i know how to train dogs and furthermore i know how to treat dogs . . not like you re angry or agressive or potentially holding them in a way that can cause injury . . otherwise they hate the bath session forever ! i won t be back . .

0,"greasy pizza , rude owners . . . now i see that they made the channel news dirty dining show with major health code violations . . . yikes doesn t surprise me"
0,"this is just a bad place to eat period . i ordered a pizza and was told it would be ready in mins , i showed up on time and asked for my order two of the employees huddled up really . quick and one went to the back the other said it would be a few mins . the other girl never came back up and the other girl was making a huge excuse about the register being locked . i know they never put my order in as the girl trying to unlock the register was playing with her phone more than trying to fix the problem . after waiting mins i walked out and when i said i was she made no last ditch effort to save the sale other than are u sure ? i would give this place a zero star and would never visit this site again .

0,"this place is just gross . but a good place to watch sports and that s it . food is horrible . n nsometimes i am forced to come here for lunch during the work week . is it bad when you don t want to order one thing off the menu ? ? ! n ni will give props to the outdoor patio area but this place is just a straight up bar . there are many tv s for viewing and shouting , whichever you prefer . "
0,food was only ok but the real problem was the service . our waitress was obviously not into waitressing on this particular day . it took about hours to get a burger and a beer the special . the actual beer took a good minutes to make it to the table . what ? ! ? i can see the bar from here and nothing is happening . where is my bud light ? ! ? 
0,worst service i ve ever had . waited min for dishes and the restaurant wasn t busy . we never even had a waitress . just random workers checking on us and apologizing . very disappointing . this used to be one of my favorite places to eat . 
0,"much like the store on eastern this store is in desperate need of some cleaning and organizing . the clothes are packed on the racks that is the ones that are not laying on the floor with employees stepping over them , and the fitting room floors are full of pins . so , if you re wanting to be stuck in the foot with a filthy pin just come here ! no excuse for that ! for pete s sake keep your shoes on when using the fitting room here . n nwhile in the fitting room i noted that the security dopes had an office right there . i listened to the bs war stores about the tough scene that is being a security guard at burlington coat factory . . . . these brave hearts tales of their tough incidents inspired me . . . . . . to want to vomit . they should be moved to a back room where they cannot embarrass themselves . n nlook , i know burlington is a cheapo store for cheapo people but i have learned that i can still be cheap and shop in a safe and clean store . i have since used j . c . penney and macy s at the galleria with immense delight and new found locality . its just as cheap ! and the employees are able to fake caring well and the merch is well displayed and cared for . burlington coat factory is right on the heels of ross dress for less , another dump .

0,"i like a good brunch , and bistro la bon is just decent . as other yelpers said , the brunch buffet has items that you wouldn t imagine would really work for brunch . the buffet included meats , veggies , fruits , cabbage and i m just more of an eggs and bacon kind of girl . bucks a pop for brunch is a little steep for me , plus the cost of coffee . for two of us , it was over . glad i tried it , but probably won t be back for brunch . perhaps dinner would be better here .

0,"nakama is one of those places that pleases the masses . go during happy hour , and you won t be able to hear the person next to you . the cocktail list is big and enticing , but the drinks aren t anything to write home about . sushi is relatively good , albeit moderately overpriced . this is the type of place you go for the atmosphere , not the amazing food .

0,"manager chrystal is extremely rude and was supposed to fix an issue for me that was caused by lorenzo the pony tailed scam artist of at t which i was informed by customer care was never fixed , and she treated me like a liar without even bothering to pull up my account info . also she was talking over me when i was trying to explain my problem and when i had to raise my voice said stop yelling or i m going to hang up on you ! i am absolutely appalled by how ive been treated by the employees at this location they give an awesome company like at t a bad name . when you go through the best phone carrier you d expect to get the best treatment especially when you ve paid them a deposit the least they could do is not rip you off for insurance you never wanted and give the discount you were promised when you were promised it . lorenzo is a sexist scam artist please don t let him assist you if you are a female i told him i don t want insurance and he said yea i think you need it and put it on my account anyways now months later i m still being charged for it ! also he grilled me about my last name and embarrassed me while he was setting up my account which took hours .

0,"the wife and i have been coming here for over a year . when we first went the service was very good , friendly , and it felt like our business was appreciated . i don t know what happened but . . . . n nout of the last three times we came the waiter the same one each time didn t take our drink orders , was very impatient while we were ordering , and my wife had to chase down a different waiter for water . fyi , all three times the waiter was that fat one that another reviewer found very rude short . speaking about the wait staff , did someone scare off all the female employees ? n nthe strangest part is that food is exactly the same fantastic . i wish yelp would let us differentiate between the food , place , and staff as the food would easily get stars while the staff well , that staff that s left would get . n nit s very rare that i d let the wait staff get to me as usually a return visit gets me a different waiter , but this place is so small that s not an option . right now i ll just resign myself to finding a different pho place .

0,"went to this place for lunch with some friends , ordered the food to go . obviously they are in no rush whatsoever , even when you ask after minutes where the food is . n nthere were maybe or orders ahead of us , and we all got basic burger combos . we actually watched them make our hamburgers , and i m pretty sure the cooks had never made one in their entire life or thought that if they stared at the patty long enough all of their problems would be answered . this is not gourmet food , this is fast food . n noverall it took us half an hour from order to walking out the door . no apologies even given . fries were done well before burgers , so they sat under a light in front of us for most of the time . ridiculous . will not go back , and highly encourage the rest of you to not go .

0,"can be great , can be crap . i don t know how many people ever order wings without sauce but twice this place has delivered my wings sauceless . we were staying at the hooters hotel and the restaurant screws up wings . that is supposed to be their thing ! boy was that disappointing , then when i ask for sauce they gave me attitude as if i wanted to just get free sauce . you already don t expect much from a hooters restaurant but to get less than expected is pretty shameful .

0,"this is a letter i sent to the food and beverage people at this hotel n ni live in las vegas and i am an above average consumer of local shows , dining and casinos . n ni was at the same time appalled and amused by a low class free drink promotion at your burlesque show . we were given coupons to use after the show at the bar downstairs for a free drink . n nat the bar , all six of us were told that we had to buy a drink and then we would get a free drink . n nif you were on our side of the bar , instead of yours , would you consider this a free drink ? doesn t this vastly expand the meaning of the word free ? n nas there are classier places to spend our money than your club we intend to do so . i m sure you will do well with the tourist trade and maybe sell a few drinks with this promotion . n nhowever one day you will get written up on the many travel sites that tourists read before they go to a city . n nno matter to us there are so many other places to go to . n nby the way , i won t post this on a travel site as you may quietly decide that a few drink sales are not worth the potential for being rated as low as some of the strip bars in the area . n ni since decided to post this on travel websites .

0,"the best thai we ve eaten lately . . . is not here . sushi was ok . we stopped here during happy hour so at least the price was decent . on the other hand , we overpaid for everything else so i guess it evened out in the end . the green papaya salad was so excruciatingly hot it practically ruined our pallettes . the thai beef salad , which was bucks , was the size of a side salad . it was dressed in that really sweet vinegar sugar dressing and the beef was like leather . overall , not a good experience . for thai from now on we ll just drive to pam real thai on decatur . the food there is absolutely incredible !

0,"what the hell was i thinking ? it s time to blow this hotel into oblivion . the place had more kids running wild than michael jackson s love grotto . sure i saved a few bucks on the room , but i spent the savings on cab rides to the part of the strip that actually has a pulse . the dealers looked ashamed and pissed like they failed some card dealing course and this was their continuation school . the buffet is pukable at best and the rooms require a hazmat suit on entry . perhaps a small price to pay for being on the strip , but now i have lice .

0,"i called this company solely based on a yelp review . i wanted to spend my money in the community . i had friends coming in from hawaii , and needed a yard clean up . i called and scheduled an estimate day . the owner , jason , came to the house and couldn t have been nicer . very pleasant . i told him i needed the back yard completely raked , the river rocks cleaned out and some of them re set because the u bc washes in during heavy rains . depending upon the estimate , i said i d also consider having the front yard raked and cleaned . he said he d have laura call me back with an estimate and options for scheduling . i thought that was kinda odd , given he s the owner and certainly knows how much he would charge to do something . anyway , a half hour later , i got a vm from laura saying they wouldn t be able to service my property because there wasn t enough work for the crew and that the minimum charge would exceed the actual cost of the work . what ? i ve had this done before and it wasn t a small fee . quite honestly , i think the job was deemed somewhat a pain and the company didn t want to do it . reading the company s statement of services at the bottom of their yelp page , i can say it s not accurate .

0,"i don t know why everyone gives the store in tempe a good review . i just went today to make a simple purchase of a table and chair for my grandson and it was a nightmare . i have never liked the layout of ikea , finding it confusing and illogical . sure enough i was trying to find the children s section . no signs , and no sign of anyone work working on the floor . i wander around and finally find it , pick out what i want and get a shopping cart . that s where i hit my first major snag . the cart doesn t wheel right . it goes all over the place . i decide to ditch it and get one in self service figuring they have to have them there also . of course they don t because that would be logical . i happen upon one that was left there and guess what ? that one also doesn t wheel right . like the other one it wheels all over the place . i can barely control it . i press on tho to get my items and can t find one of them but there are workers there so i ask one about the missing item . he has to call someone in that dept . really ? you can t just help me find the right bin ? while i m waiting i find the item myself and struggle to get the cart to one of only two cashiers working . to get the sale price of my items , i find out i have to belong to the ikea family . at this point i don t want to belong to this moronic family but i want my discount . i m told i have to join at the kiosk . its pointed out to me by a worker running from me . nice . i can t get the kiosk to work . no help around now . another customer asks the cashier who gives us forms to fill out to get the card . apparently after you go to the kiosk you have to fill out this paperwork for the card anyway . huh ? and why didn t the cashier tell me that in the first place ? i m now beginning to suspect the workers are sadists who like to see us suffer . ni purchase my items but now i have to figure out how to get my uncontrollable cart out of the store and to my car . i find that heaving the cart away from me gets it to move the most feet . i crash it into a wine rack . i don t care there are no workers around anyway . i heave it some more and manage to get it out the door to my car . it took me an hour and a half to purchase a simple table and chair . i don t plan on visiting my new family ever again .

0,"as i read other yelp reviews , i begin to think . . . i m sure we didn t order the right things . this place was a huge disappointment and robbed us of our time and money . n nwe stumbled upon this place because they were the only nice restaurant still open late at the cosmopolitan , where we were staying . n nwe sat inside a very dark dining room where i could barely make out my boyfriend s face . the music was blaring and i couldn t talk to my date , besides yelling it wasn t intimate . n nthe menu is expansive and rather tedious to look through . we decided on a few sushi rolls and nigiri . n ni always start with a miso soup for a small bowl and you have to mix in your own miso paste . i mixed all of my miso paste into the hot water . . . but it didn t blend in well and took me a while . when it was finally blended it was not warm anymore . so i was pretty much sipping on room temperature miso . to top it off , it was bland . n nit s appalling how much they charge for sushi rolls that come out in or small pieces . i recall the dragon eel , avocado , radish sprouts it s just your typical caterpillar roll nothing extravagant . the eel was your standard eel and not even with a thicker piece of meat , paper thin avocado , and radish sprouts . crazy simple and no frills . it came out in small pieces and was . . it wasn t memorable and i only remember that there was a lot of radish sprout flavor . n nwe also ordered the ebi tempura fried shrimp , radish sprouts , avocado just like your typical crunchy roll . nothing about this was fancy or special . all i recall was tasting radish sprouts and rice . . and it came out in pieces . n n . for piece if sake salmon nigiri . we had to order of them and spent over for small pieces of nigiri . the salmon was cut thinner than the average sushi restaurant . it was fresh and buttery but there wasn t anything special about it and not worth the price that they charge . n nwe spent well over for bits of food here and there and lots of radish sprouts and we left unsatisfied and hungry .

0,"i have been waiting for the opportunity to try stalzy s . a local review praised the quality and quantity of the food . the best part of the corned beef sandwich was the bread . at for a rueben , it should be worth . when you take a bite of your sandwich , you shouldn t pull out the entire contents . large amounts of fat were included , at no charge . things they could do to improve . . . thinner slices and better trimmed meat and include a side for !

0,"sadly , i must update my review . i have been here three more times after my initial review and all three times waited exponentially longer than the time i was told . on this last occasion the lady on the phone told me mins so i left my house after twenty minutes , arriving five minutes after that . i went in , gave her my name and they said it would be right out . i sat down . i watched three people come in , place their order , and walk out with their food . i went to yhe counter and asked about my food . she left to go in the back and said it wasn t ready yet . i gave her a look of bewilderment as it had been about mins since i placed my order . i sat back down . ten minutes later , she brings me my food and tells me she s sorry it took so long . that my order had actually been ready for a while and was sitting in a place she didn t know to look . needless to say food was wet from condensation , cold , and less than unsatisfactory . so sad . i wanted to like this place ! nwhat did i order ? five tacos and a torta .

0,"i was an urban active member and full disclosure have not visited the place since they changed to la fitness . i was still paying my membership though ! . n nlast week , i had to cancel my card because of some unrelated fraudulent charges . immediately , i had every la fitness facility in the country calling me several times a day with aggressive demands for payment or really insistent sales pitches . i often work nights , so this was definitely not ok . each time , i informed them that i would pay the fee and cancel my membership at the la fitness facility itself when the weekend was over yes , it was the weekend . i have been a regular paying member at this facility for nearly four years , and they thought it was appropriate to treat me like some fraudster running from the law . i have never been so happy to cancel a membership . n nif you are interested in becoming a member here , my recommendation is to wait a little while first . either this place goes out of business , gets sold again , or membership fees go through the floor .

0,"went here for dinner with my boss and another co worker . the place looks cool from the outside and the host at the front was very friendly and helpful . other than the guy playing the guitar tableside , the positives stopped here . our server was the coolest guy in the room , just ask him , he ll tell you all about it . the food was all terrible . it was all cold , even the mini cheeseburgers that were brought out because the owner wanted to buy us an appetizer . this is a cheesy line they use to make you feel like you re getting something for all of those incredibly overpriced drinks you re buying . my boss said he was pretty sure that his prime rib was reheated from the day before , and my salmon had an awful odor flavor . the cool atmosphere , friendly hosts , and guitar guy who naile ring of fire , when we requested it make it worth stopping in at happy hour to buy a reasonably priced drink , but otherwise not worth it at all . "
0,"this is one of the strangest restaurants ever . the entrance is an almost hidden door at the corner of a block that leads you into a narrow , not so clean staircase down into the basement . you might mistaken buying lunch for buying some other questionable things , but rest assure you re going the right way . at the bottom of the stairs you ll see a door that only opens if you re still standing on the stairs because otherwise it will hit you . okay , now you re in the restaurant . n nwhen you first walk in , you ll find a row of refrigerators with beverages like you would at a gas station convenient store . the difference is that the whole row is filled with beer , all kinds of beer . you can get s , packs of domestic , imports , hard lemonades , etc . n nafter describing all that , the weirdest part is . . . this is a fast food korean restaurant ! you can get bulgogi , kalbi , duk in soup , kim chi , etc . weird right ? the food is decent and it s a great lunch spot in the heart of oakland . if you haven t been here , just the experience is worth the trip !

0,"read alot of positive reviews about this place but just goes to show you have to try it out for yourself to believe it . have tried other places like delux and charr and prefer either of those two to this place . was not impressed with the ambiance . service was slow . as for the food , i would rate their burgers ok but not great and definitely not as good as the other burger places i have reviewed check my other reviews . n nprice wise they seem all on par as all sides are priced separately . main concern for me is the quality of the food and do i like hanging out at this place with my buddies and colleagues for an evening of drinks and food . this is ok but i would not go out of my way to get here . if service is better next time may notch it up a star . right now i can find much better places for a good burger . . .

0,"i am embarrassed to say the least that i am even admitting the fact that i stayed here once upon a time . let s just say my boyfriend at the time was a total cheap ass and wouldn t pay for us to stay at a normal hotel . n nwell , as for the actual hotel . there isn t much to say that i m sure everyone doesn t already know . it was a travelodge for heavens sake ! n ni did however notice when we first arrived that there were a bunch of gangsters hanging out in the parking lot in front of the hotel near the strip . it seemed odd to me because for whatever reason , i didn t think vegas would have gangsters . my ignorance i suppose n nanyhoo . . . i believe it was our third night there , we were fast asleep when no joke , we hear gunshots . and this wasn t gunshots from blocks away , these were close range shots . my ex then jumped up and threw us both on the floor . n nafter we determined it was safe to get up , we heard cops . we didn t think much of it until they got closer . n nto make a long story short , it turns out that one room over from us is where the shooting happened . the gunshots went through a wall into the next room next door to us . n nwe never found out who shot who or what really happened , but let s just say that i will never stay at the gangsterlodge again .

0,"i ve made it a general rule of lifestyle to stay out of nightclubs unless i m traveling . usually , this means internationally , but planet las vegas comes close to a foreign place and so i decided that we absolutely had to go to a club . my boyfriend who is older and knows better protested , but what does that matter anyway , i had a new dress , new shoes , and the good faith recommendation of none other than paris hilton hey she knows , riiiight . . . we also had a voucher for one free admission , this ended boyfriends protests , but when we arrived we were told it was a special event so they wouldn t honor it . the special event turned out to be a dj playing top s hits , so whatever , i guess everyone is special in vegas though , riiight . n nyou know how it goes , there were cheap beers , and no place to sit if you hadn t reserved your own booth for million dollars . i kept getting shooed away from leaning against these booths by the private security guards that occupy each one , pushing the dancing crowd back with the roped off entrances to these many booths , making the already crowded dance floor smaller and smaller . at one point i attempted to relieve my aching feet by taking my shoes off in the corner while i finished a drink , but was then asked by another security guard to put them back on the girls on stage had no shoes ! no sympathy from that guy though . this could all be anticipated , but wouldn t have rubbed me such the wrong way if the club had been bigger , and cooler , better decorated , or more unique . it really was just another club , without enough room to dance , and too many security guards reminding you that even though you paid for me , for boyfriend to get in , that s not enough to truly exist in their eyes . also , very smokey and people dancing with lit cigarettes on the tiny dance floor put my new dress in jeopardy and to a lesser degree my bodily parts , which will not stand .

0,"randy s is a longtime local scottsdale business with fast , fast , fast service and decent short order cook style breakfast , lunch and dinner . i like that there is an extensive menu but the charm is that you can just tell the waitress what you want and they can produce it for you in less than a minute . small town feel in a big city with a fast food restaurant order elegance . if you don t like to cook your own scrambled eggs , this is a good option for you . i wouldn t expect any fancy omelets or ingredients and presentation is unnecessary it would just slow the food down which comes out very quickly . n ni was turned off by the hostess that can t say hi while taking your name . i know its busy and the service is fast , fast , fast they are fast but say hi and good morning , its just polite . remember , small town feel , big city ? n ni don t like sitting down when the tip is still on the table from the last guest . i know that i am not the only person going to sit at that table but it feels like the table didn t get a good break between guests . the table was wiped clean but still , make it feel like it is ready for a new customer . i also found a hair in my food , an eyelash . i think it could have been mine , yes , i am going to say it s mine , probably fell out when i blinked after i ordered and my food arrived . too bad , i don t eat as fast because it was obvious that we needed to get out , out , out for the next customer .

0,"upon walking in , i stood for a few minutes and noticed older women preparing to exit , there were employees standing by the door , neither one opened the door for these women , i actually held both the interior and exterior doors for them , very loudly they thanked me and referred to me jokingly as the doorman an older gentleman stated that this act of kindness was wonderful and while looking at the two employees , i responded i was simply raised correctly the host asked me how many were in my party while the server went to start opening the door for guests . i responded that i had people and the other one should arrive within a couple minutes . the host then grabbed menus and told me to follow him . i started to walk with him , he stops puts the menus back into the host stand and then informs me it will be a few minutes . looking around , i did notice more than tables that were empty dirty so for me to be told to follow him and then be told basically nevermind was a little confusing . my server karen took minutes to deliver my iced tea and my sister s water . karen came up to our table and asked for our order but before we could answer her , she actually walked away from us , to take someone else s order ! after she took their order she came back to finally ask us what we wanted , but then said hold on and began talking to another server behind our table and started to clean the table with her . finally when that table was almost cleared she came up to us and never once apologized , simply asking what we would like ? i calmly with a smile , asked for another server please she looked at me confused and walked back to the table behind us and finished clearing it with the other server and you could tell she was talking very inappropriate about us . she walked away a few minutes later , was gone for a few , came back to the table and asked do you know who you would like to serve you karen was really trying my patience at this point , with the same calm smile i simply stated someone better than her she sent mike r over , who i stupidly assumed was a manager , he was not , when i explained what had just happened while he was bent down elbows on the table like he was a friend joining us for dinner which for the record i think is so annoying , he simply stated as he threw his hands up how are you doing tonight , how are you doing tonight i quickly realized he was not a manager , because i know for a fact that is not how a manager would have handled the situation . we gave him our order , which was the for and ordered the spinach dip for starters . my steak i asked for medium rare and my sister ordered the nawlins skillet . he was trying to get us to smile , but the annoying thing that i do not like is how he kept referring to me as boss my name is not boss do not refer to me as that ! while we waited for our appetizer i noticed that karen was not doing too well with her other tables , she actually picked her rear end times while she was talking to the couple across from us , witnessed by more than just myself and my sister ! we referred to her as typhoid karen for the rest of the evening . i over heard her telling someone that you did not have enough dishes so of course people will just have to understand that referring to the fact that another group of people had to wait for their food to be delivered . . . if this were the case , come on buy some more dishes , or better yet , hire some faster kitchen staff ! ! i do not think guests should ever be told that you do not have enough plates to go around so we should just expect to wait . our appetizer was delivered , long after i felt it should have been and basically was plopped onto our table , the girl delivering it i only saw once and she never responded when my sister and i both thanked her . with the exception of being called boss repeatedly and the kneeling down to our table , mike r was not that bad , he kept apologizing for everything taking so long . we were there for well over an hour , which i felt , was way too long . it did not take us long to eat our meals . everything was the wait for our food and our drinks . never once did a manager approach our table , i might be mistaken , but from what i recall , whenever there is an issue like that , a server should advise the manager to visit the table . i never once witnessed a manager at all . i understand that this is just applebee s , but seriously it is not like we were ordering off the . menu at mcdonalds , i would expect better service here . i would also expect a server to refrain from digging in her rear yes it was on the outside of the pants , but still ! ! until she is in the bathroom or away from the dining patrons . my sister also informed me that when the server swung the door open to allow her to enter he did so in a matter that it almost hit her in the face because of the force of which he threw the door open . she had to take a step back as the door almost greeted her face .

0,"my wife and i were sent on a famous starbucks run last saturday for the family . we remembered the new location , and were super excited to be able to check it out . however , when we got there we were less than pleased . as mentioned , this starbucks definitely is not as fast as others , but we felt that was excusable , because it is a brand new location they probably have some kinks to work out . but what was not excusable was the mess also mentioned in another review , barista area was filthy , covered in spills . it didn t seem like anyone was worried about cleaning up either . and the horrible customer service . curtis was making our drinks , and he clearly can not handle a stressful situation , which probably means he shouldn t be working at starbucks but that s beyond the point . we ordered just drinks no crazy orders , either and the location at this time was not to busy pm on a saturday every employee looked confused and were clearly lacking communication skills with each other . as the drinks came up slowly i started grabbing them to get them out of the way , and as i grabbed a drink , curtis shouted rudely , your welcome . with a roll of the eyes . i then went up for the last drink , and asked if we could get a drink carrier instead of making any eye contact , curtis sighed , and shouted now we need a drink carrier , can someone get it . a manager shouts back that they are out , so he turns to us and shrugs his shoulders while saying we re out . thankfully a manager offered us a box , because clearly curtis wasn t concerned . getting frustrated , we thanked the manager and made a comment referencing curtis lack on interest in helping us , and his response in front of the manager was sorry for our busyness . thanks , bye . not only am i appalled that an employee would ever treat a customer like this i am completely shocked that an manager would not address the issue , and apologize for her employees lack of social skills . this starbucks needs managers that know how to manage and keep their employees under control . so far , i am completely turned off from this location . and it seems as if i am not the only one as we were leaving another customer made a comment to us asking , what was up with that ? that guy must forget that he is there to make drinks , be polite and smile , huh ? we all agreed we will stick to the starbucks in barnes and noble .

0,"this will be a step by step guide on how to lose a customer in a day , and profit ! n nmy car had a check engine light on . hopefully you all know this but you can go to autozone and get the engine trouble codes read for free . takes a minute , they give you a printout and send you on your way . i did this and saw that my oxygen sensor was broken , with suspicion of a problem with the catalytic converter up and coming . i think , hey , i might have this under warranty . i ll take it to honda . n ni take my car to service advisor carol guyovich . i tell her the engine code i got from the car and explain my thoughts from above . i ask if it s under warranty . she explains the oxygen sensor is not , but the catalytic converter is , and that she will get back to me with the results . simple enough . carol , being the service advisor with an award on her desk , is clearly simple , straightforward , and looking out for my best interests . wrong . n ni get a call back . she says it s the oxygen sensor and that is a repair . for the part , for the labor . i say no , thanks , i ll do it myself . disclaimer i work on cars . the part is actually around , and the labor took minutes of my time . even counting a minimum half an hour of shop time , that would be what . . . in labor ? i was in a hurry , so i was left with a bill of for that conclusion . n ni do my repair but am left with a bad taste in my mouth . i check over my bill closely and notice that the only actual thing they did was do what autozone did for free , and charge me for it . this is perhaps fine for a customer who did not walk in with the trouble code readout already but i did . i walked in with that knowledge prior and she did not tell me this wasn t necessary . she did not tell me they only base their repairs on trouble codes . had i known that , what would have been the point of leaving my car there for hours ? n ni go back to talk to carol . i asked her if they simply just read the engine code , firstly , to which she said yes . i explain why i m upset . the response from her was a lecture along the lines of you came here to have your car worked on by the pros , right ? you re simplifying the job of a mechanic . he pays for his tools , his education . . . you get the idea . i say none of that was in play when he plugged in the reader for a minute and printed out the result on my bill . i already told you what was wrong with the car according to the same code and you did it anyway . and no , i wasn t here for the pros . i was here for warranty . i say that was not looking out for my best interest as a customer . she says , well you re certainly entitled to your opinion . a charge is a charge . n nand that is how you lose a customer in a day over . it also calls into question how she can be given that award for customer service on her desk . i guess honda west hands them out to pretty much anyone .

0,not a good experience here today . . . . when you come in with a friend and want to get pedicures at the same time they should be honest if it is a possibility . today i got a bad pedicure while my friend waited next to me . they never asked us if it was ok for us to get done at separate times . a walk in client came in after us and they proceeded to start on her first . they wanted to start on hers when mine was almost done . they apologized but didn t do anything to make the situation better . i will never return here . . . . .

0,"we got to this place at pm yesterday not exactly prime time for meals , so we expected it would be quick or at least timely . our waitress greeted us after a few minutes and took our drink orders . she then tended to a large table for the next minutes . we didn t get to order food until my husband flagged her down at . it still took another minutes or so before the food arrived there were only other tables at this point . a random beer was brought over by the bartender . whole i m not complaining about beer it speaks to how unorganized this place is . the food is this place s saving grace . it was delicious . the service is lacking and needs some serious help if they hope to survive . they re surrounded by other restaurants that i would gladly choose next time knowing how disappointing the service is at cowbell . we ll give it another shot in hopes that it was an off day , but we won t be recommending it to anyone just yet .

0,"disappointing . . i had out of town guests visiting , and we wanted some ice cream after our dinner . we were in the general area , and i had heard so many good things about mary coyles , that i suggested we try it out . my friends were impressed with the appearance of the place when we got there . it was about pm on sunday night . the place was reasonably busy . after looking at the menues , we decided on a peak which was listed as three flavors of ice cream with three different sauces for each scoop , and a simple sundae of peppermint bark icecream with hot fudge . n nafter waiting quite a while , our ice cream arrived . first shock the peak came in a tumbler , not in a boat or bowl . so it was three scoops of icecream all different flavors on top of one another , with the sauces all mixed in . to make matters worse , it was melted , so more like a milkshake instead of sundae . my peppermint bark sundae was also melted and mushy . the three of us ate maybe half of the sundaes . when the waitress came around to check on us , we let her know that we were disapointed in both the presentation of the peak , and the fact that both items were melty and runny . she offered to have them remade , but by this time , we just wanted to leave . she presented the bill with a discount . . woopty doo . . . no visit from a manager , no offer to take care of us next time . . . just a here is your . off . so we ended up paying something like for two runny , melted dishes glasses really of ice cream .

0,"i came here with a group of friends before going to the checkers game , a group of people . we were sat in a booth that was a little cramped , but the place was busy so we didn t mind . n nbeing an after work event , our group got there in waves . from the time we sat down until the last person got there was probably minutes . the waitress was so impatient . as soon as the last person sat down she came over and asked if we knew what we wanted to eat . well . . . yes some of us that had been there knew , but the one who just sat down my husband had not even had the chance to look at the menu . n nfrom there it only went downhill . i got the impression she was angry with us because she was just not very nice . she didn t come back to the table after that for minutes . i got the fresh house made mozzarella sandwich and it was just a sad sandwich . it sounded so good , but the ingredients were wimpy . there wasn t enough tomato which were not ripe to cover the bread , and there were maybe shreds of onion . there was nothing fresh about it . n ni also ordered an angry orchard cider not on the menu which i had to ask if there were any ciders . the waitress did not say the price but beware they are . . too expensive in my mind for that drink but what could i do at that point ? . n nthe location is convenient , but i would much rather go to queen city q .

0,"a little pricey even for vegas but their noodles and dumplings are made fresh so that kind of made up for it a little . we ordered the xiao long bao and dan dan noodles . the xiao long bao were juicy and fresh . flavor was right . the dan dan noodles were fresh as well but not enough meat in my opinion . loaded with chili oil . pretty average dishes . n nwait was pretty long for people during mid afternoon . they couldn t estimate any time and there was no where to wait . i waited around the slot machines but had to keep checking because i wasn t sure if they d take the effort to look around for me when a table opened up . decor is beautiful . lots of fish at the entrance . service was pretty boring . hardly came around and when we asked for something , she just gave it to us and walked away .

0,"i have no words to describe this place . the food was just horrible . we should have just left after eating the samosas . a place that can screw that up is definitely not worth going to . the rest of the food was crap too , including the water . never going back here for sure . "
0,"let me just state this to be clear i have been here multiple times and i would typically give it solid stars , but today i wish yelp can give negative stars . i start this review by stating i will never , ever come back to the bistro kitchen all the way ! n nmy husband i got here at noon on the nose today and though it was pretty packed , we got seated quickly towards the back . a few minutes later a screaming baby came in that should have been our sign to haul ass out of there but we were starved . n nboth of us ordered the same dish , the red curry with tofu , just at different spice levels mine a , his an i don t even know how he does that , but i digress ! and very clearly , as the lunch specials have starters with meat typically , tell the waitress that if any starters have meat in them , please don t bring them . she repeats , no meat ! and goes off to the kitchen . n nordering is almost minutes into our sitting in the restaurant . during this time , a party of come in the ones with the kid screaming like a banshee notating our exact location in hell , and the couple next to us have left and have been replaced by another two guys . n nstill waiting . n nthe guys next to us get served . and leave . and still no food and hardly any sign of our waitress . around the mark she comes out and says it ll be just another minute and half apologizes while trying to scurry away from our table . n n , our meal finally hits the table . guess what folks ? both are red curries with chicken . how did she not notice this ? ! it took a single glance to realize it was chicken their tofu is very distinct and looks nothing like chicken . after a minute of disbelief , i have to flag down the waitress who assures me she said tofu oh really ? ? well it does not matter what you said but that s not what came out and you should have you know , looked at the dish you were about to serve . she apologized , ran back and served our spring rolls that came with the lunch while we waited . after minutes she also offered some thai tea but we were both not in the mood i just wanted to eat and unfortunately this gesture did not make up for the fact that our food was late and she couldn t even glance down at the food she was serving . n nwe finally get our correct dishes at pm . the curry is decent as usual , but we were so ridiculously disappointed by this point and the busy restaurant we came into was completely cleared out . yes , the party of had left before we got our second dish . n nthis kind of issue is completely inexcusable and i am sincerely amazed that they even bothered to give us a check after waiting so long and screwing up both orders . i really love their curries and their willingness to cater to vegans , but if this were my first time here i might have actually tried to eat the curry and i can guarantee i would have had a fit of epic proportions . n nthe only good thing to come out of this is i m going to learn to make thai food at home . goodbye thai bistro , you will never see my face again .

0,"this may be the last time i go indigo . don t get me wrong , for scottsdale the price is right , and i never have a problem getting a last minute room . but it seems really rundown here and a few things left me with a sour taste during my one night stay . first up , there was a harsh smell of sewage in my room , couldn t detect where it was coming from . . . you d think the bathroom but it got more faint the closer to the bathroom i moved . also the shower tile needed to replaced a year or two ago , cracked , chipped , dingy . the food at the bar is pretty meh and it s not cheap . but justin works hard and he s up for some conversation if that s you re thing . i think i d rather spend more and hit up somewhere else in the hood like the ho or firesky .

0,"we my friends and i really only go here on tuesday nights for their cent taco tuesday special . my friends had been going here forever for this special and we decided to make it a weekly thing . this has been going on for a while now and i ve since tried all their tacos . i m sad to say that most of them are just okay . the one that stands out above the rest is the shredded beef taco . the beef is seasoned well and is tasty . none time we went i didn t feel like eating tacos so i got their steak burrito . it was not very good . the rice that came with my combo was bland and barely edible . i actually left most of the burrito and all of the rice on my plate . i left feeling unimpressed and still hungry . another time i got the chicken achiote salad . it was delicious . if you decide to eat here , it s probably the only thing i would recommend . other than the daily specials they run , this place is pretty expensive for the quality . that salad and a bottled mexican coca cola ran me more than . same thing for the burrito combo . the tacos seem to be the only economical choice they offer . n nno matter how good the service is i don t think that i would ever give chico s stars , but they lost a rd star from me because the last times i ve been in there , the older lady who works at night on tuesday has goofed up my order . yes , times . weeks in a row my order was messed up . i don t know if maybe she is new and hasn t gotten the hang of it yet , or if she just wasn t paying attention to me when i was placing my order . i could understand more why my order was goofed if i had ordered something ridiculous with lots of substitutions , but i didn t . the last time my order was messed up it took them mins after they realized their mistake to remedy the situation . by that time my friends were all done eating the tacos they had ordered . i don t mean to make it sound like a bigger deal than it is , but because my order was messed up so many times it makes it hard for me to want to continue giving them my business , especially since i m not that crazy about their food in the first place . n ni m sure i ll be back again , as tacos are really the highlight of an otherwise boring tuesday . but if my order gets messed up again i think i ll just suggest to friends that we do taco tuesday at another mexican restaurant . that ll probably take some convincing though , they love this place . i m still trying to figure out why .

0,"to start off our evening the chips and salsa weren t very good salsa had no spice at all . i ordered the ocho , which was a chile relleno and a spinach enchilada with a jalape u f o cream cheese sauce . the chile relleno was pretty good while the spinach enchilada was a little crispy and the spinach almost seemed partially frozen . the rice and beans were alright at best with the beans lacking much flavor . the staff was friendly and service was pretty quick . we were surprised to have to wait min to be seated at pm on a wednesday night .

0,"this is my recent unpleasant experice at albertsons located at south stephanie street , henderson nv n . ntheir promotion was to buy certain items and receive credit for future shopping . during check out the promotion didn t print . when asked , they seemed clueless as to why it didn t print . since i bought all of the items and amount specified in their promo . one of the workers who said she was the manager figured maybe it s one of the item , because one is for shower and one is for regular use . they still didn t seem to know , but they expect the customer to know some how . . anyway , they said they would need to return all of my groceries , and re scan them all over again to see if that might be the reason . . in which time i was really getting irritated with the untrained cashier and the lady who claimed she was a manager , but didn t really know what she was doing . . n nin the end another manager came and fixed the problem , without having to re scan all of the items . the cashier and the fake manager kept talking rudely and the manager told them to be quiet . overally , we wasted alot of time and it ruined our day . albertsons at this location highly not recommended .

0,"i ve eaten at loch fyne in newhaven , edinburgh a couple of times now and have yet to be blown away . n nthe most recent visit , the food was lovely , not superb , but nice however the fact that we felt as if we were being ignored the entire time overshadowed menu . n nwhen they realised the wine we ordered was out , they decided to give us to free glasses , which was kind , however they didn t inform us until about minutes after we ordered it , when we had to call the waitress over ask where our drinks were . n nduring after the meal , the wine list was never reproduced for us to order something else or them to have an upsell . n nwe had to get the waitresses attention to order bring the bill which there was a mistake on she stood with her back to us most of the time cutting bread which we didn t get any of because we didn t order a starter maybe ? n nlove the area view , the food is nice , just a shame the staff we had at least didn t pay more attention .

0,"i was referred to go to this place by a buddy after a conversation about how i get shin splints after runs . he told me how the experts that work there will be able to see how you run and suggest a perfect shoe specifically for you . n ni decided i would check it out . i was helped by a young kid who was clearly still in high school , maybe not even older than a junior . he had me run up and down the path as he watched my running style . he explained that i needed a special shoe to correct the way i ran . i bought these shoes for over the most i have ever spent on running shoes . n noff to the track i headed , excited to get a run in without the post run shin splints . i have to say after this run i did not have any shin splints , however the muscles on the front of my shins hurt so bad the next day i could barely walk . i thought it was just something that i had to adjust to so i decided to try another run . the same thing happened , but this time the pain was much worst . at this point i knew that something wasn t right . n ni took the shoes back and this time i was helped by an older gentleman who knew way too much about running and shoes than any human being should . after having me run up and down the path he knew right away that i was prescribed the wrong shoes by the kid who helped me the st time . he offered to either exchange my shoes or return them . i chose to return them and save and buy the shoes somewhere else . n nthe prices there are way too high . i am all about supporting small businesses , but it is sad when a corporate giant like footlocker is less then a ma and pa shop like this place . i feel like they over complicate the process of buying a pair of running shoes and that is how they charge so much , much like a shady mechanic does with your car .

0,"if i could give them stars , i would . you pay a mandatory resort fee of a night that supposedly goes to pool , internet access , parking , fitness center . their pool is closed until april not like i would use their dirty pool anyway , parking is impossible to find , the internet is spotty . now i have to visit the nasty fitness center to get my worth of this stupid resort fee . i just hope i don t contract anything from the machines . look , i don t mind paying a resort fee if i feel like i am getting something out of it . in other places i paid higher resort fees and i had access to an amazingly clean fitness center , a great pool , good internet service and hassle free parking . n nnever staying in this lame hotel ever again . the only reason we made the mistake of staying here this time was because it was a last min trip and it was the cheapest option , and we were trying to save a few bucks . i would have paid a bit more per night to save ourselves from the nasty smoky smell , the gangs of people that look like the dregs of a reality show , really thin walls , dirty rooms , shitty view , and dumb mandatory resort fee . on top of that when i asked the front desk about the resort fee and why i had to pay for it if one of these facilities were closed , she literally laughed and with an attitude , corrected me to tell me that it isn t an optional fee and that it is part of the hotel fee . wow . i am glad she knows the difference between mandatory and optional . that wasn t my question .

0,"just like yelp says , i have experienced better . n ni came here late night with a friend after getting our ears pierced . wasn t completely empty , but the staff had already begun closing up shop for the night . we were seated immediately . the waiter pretty much told us that we needed to order within the next five minutes or else the kitchen wouldn t prepare our food for us . we were there minutes before the closing time . n ntheir rolls menu is a bit confusing , because it has one side with the prices for about different rolls , and on the back there is a description for only about half of them . we ordered four of the rolls that were described on the back . ended up going with the las vegas roll , shrimp tempura roll , caterpillar roll and spicy tuna roll and miso soup to start . n nthe miso soup was very below average . it had a fishy taste , which was awkward and didn t smell pleasant . on the upside , it was steamy hot . the rolls came out about minutes later and to be honest , i was not impressed at all . n nthe las vegas roll was smothered in some sort of sweet orange colored sauce which was very unappetizing on top of a cream cheese , avocado , and smoked tuna deep fried contraption . the spicy tuna roll was not cold rather lukewarm and was not spicy at all . the caterpillar roll was actually pretty decent , but had more avocado on top than was necessary and not enough fish inside . the tempura roll was the best out of all of them which says a lot about the quality of their food . the tempura around the shrimp was a little soggy , and this roll was also lukewarm which was very unappetizing . n nthe service was pretty bland , nothing special . prices weren t bad either . we split the bill and paid about bucks each , which isn t terrible for rolls , soups and drinks . n noverall , i probably won t be back in the near future . n npictures of the food are posted .

0,"we saw good reviews on yelp and expected some gourmet bagels and good service . however , once we arrived we were rushed to order , it did not look very clean , and the bagel sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches were mediocre for the relatively high price we paid for an egg bagel sandwich . this place is just another bagel joint i would not recommend ordering anything else . we went out of our way to explore this shop , but we probably would have been better off going to einsteins .

0,"i just got back from here and first off , we waited for over an hour for our food . the people who had come in and ordered way after us were served first , which was rude . second , i heard them talking about being out of biscuits and gravy about minutes before they actually told us they were . granted , they did take off after we said something , but the food wasn t even that impressive . i m definitely never going back .

0,"i walked through the door this morning for a tour so that i find a place closer to home to board my fur babies in a few weeks . i was greeted by a strong pet urine odor . i wanted to leave bit figured things would get better , after all i m sure their are lots of cats dogs in and out of the place . after a few minutes i still was not greeted so i apprpached the counter and told the young lady that i was told to stop by for a tour . another lady approached and as the tour began anpther employee approached to tell her to handle something else and that she would do the tour . she told me that since one of my dogs is spayed and that the other wasn t the play area didn t really apply . we went into the area where the dogs stay foe boarding and explained the difference between the large and suite . i was surprised that this arwa actually smelled more clean than the feont desk area . i asked why the room next to the one that she was showing had pee and poop on the ground . her response was that they are behind and that they had probably moved the dog that was there . whatever the reason as animal lovers we all k b ow what poop that has been sitting looks like vs the fresh stuff . this had obviously been there a while . anyway i continued the tour and got info on any additional requirements . typically i board closer to the airport once or twice a year . we are the family that likes to find pet friendly places and beaches we take road trips . in the rare instance that we go out of town for a quick weekend trip and cannot take them it would be nice to have a place close to home . i advised the lady that i had a fee concerns but would like to register just in case . figuring that to nights should be ok with my other halfs approval as we were registering my pups i was told that they could not accept the records that i had administered the parvo in . i explained how i had all of the records from qhen my sister gave me the little pup when i was in delaware visiting earlier in the year . my nephew is almost and really has no interest in caring for a dog . my sister knows that i am an animal lover and wanted me to have her . before boarding the flight she had her rabies updated but the vet could not give the parvo the same day because she is so small it would likely make her sick . i waited a month and administered the parvo here at home . i purchased it from the stock shop in glendale and deove it home packed in my lunch box complete with ice packs . i ve admistered drugs to human beings and am confident in my ability to follow directions to administer to my legged family . i digress . . the young lady asked me to hold on so that she could ask her manager . her manager said that they could accept it of i got in writing from the vet that it was ok for me to administer the vaccine . all of my paperwork clearly showed that all of her immunizations ect . . . had been done in delaware prior to march of this year . who has time to jump through hoops for a smelly place that charges more than their better suited competitors ? i will glady drive the minutes to a place that i know will take care of my babies or consider one of the better places . fyi when i called my partner my way home she wanted to know why i bothered trying to register them in the first place with all of the red flags . choose another place of you can !

0,"brought our car in because it was slipping gears . paid through the nose for a new torque convertor . took longer than we expected and when we got the car back , it was making a strange clicking noise that it hadn t made prior to the repair . we took the car back , left it for another two days and they couldn t figure out where the noise was coming from . they said they could change the transfer case for an additional which may solve the problem . we decided not to leave it there and instead , my husband diagnosed the noise himself . it was the speedometer cable rattling around . my husband also noticed that the transmission was leaking fluid and it turns out that when they put the drip pan back on , they didn t tighten everything down . we would not recommend this aamco and will not return there .

0,the only positive thing i can say about this place is that at least we had a groupon . the service was slow not sure who are server even was . there were of us . i had the nachos they were the most flavorless nachos i ve ever had . my grandfather ordered ribs but they didn t have any . it was lunch time so i have no idea how they could be out . he got the pulled pork instead our friend got the pulled pork as well . the fries that came with the pulled pork were still hard not cooked all the way through . they had some flavor i think they could have been really good had they been properly fried . my grandfather said the pulled pork didn t have a lot of flavor the buns were so soggy that they couldn t pick them up to eat the sandwich . the bbq sauce was too sweet the pork lacked flavor . the cole slaw was flavorless soggy cabbage . had someone come to check on us soon after the food was delivered we would have sent the food back . definitely will not go back nor recommend . it s not even worth the star i had to leave .

0,"once when i was on a nonstop flight from salt lake to washington dc , in lieu of all the reading material i had brought with me , i ended up getting sucked into a marathon viewing of tabatha s salon takeover on bravo . after four and a half hours of salon employee improvement and makeover reality tv i can say that this nail salon could definitely stand some tabatha type attention . n it wasn t as awful as some of the previous reviews , the lady who did my nails was quiet and seemed to stay generally focused aside from having to answer the phone every time it rang . i didn t wait very long before she started on my pedicure and she listened to what i wanted just filing my nails no clipping . the massage chairs work on the bottom and back there s a lot going on there if you want it , or you can adjust using the controls . she did a fine job on my toes . n my major complaint comes as we moved over to the manicure . the tables were gross ! ! i wanted to ask for a sponge and some lysol to start cleaning myself . the manicure tables were dirty and small . another customer commented on the cramped space and someone mentioned that they would be getting new tables soon . i can only hope that someone might be bothered to keep the layer of grime off the new ones , but i doubt it . n grand total for the experience was for the mani pedi . it was passable , but they could be doing a lot better . improve the customer interaction , and clean up ! next time i m in vegas i ll find somewhere else to get my nails done .

0,"location is great , as is the ambiance , but the server seemed unhappy to be there and the food was only mediocre . i would suggest going elsewhere ! "
0,"the short review customer service reps are generally helpful , but the sales guy is a scammer . watch out and be sure you ask all questions anticipating any situation or they will make sure it always works only to their advantage and not to the customer s . now the long review . . . here s what happened to us n ni got a phone on my normal upgrade time . i wanted one with a keyboard . not a touchscreen , since i d had problems with a previous touchscreen phone . they sold me an lg env at a different location . however , i had to buy a data package . had to . apparently it was the verizon law . i bought the cheapest i could month . i barely used the data package , because the screen was too small for you to see anything on any web browser . it s not a smartphone . just a regular phone . ripoff for this series of events . n nabout a year and a half later , i visit this particular location by chandler mall . the helpful customer service rep mentioned that perhaps i d like to check into a smartphone . i told him what features i used and was looking for including a full keyboard and he showed me the one i could get when my plan was up or upon early upgrade time . n nmaybe a month later , my phone started giving me problems . it wasn t working right . i went back in , looking for the same helpful guy , thinking i could give him the sale . he was off , and he wasn t a sales person . i told the manager how helpful he was , anyway , in case his raise was coming up or bonus time or something . they gave me another sales person . he informed me that they were having a buy , get free sale on the smartphones i was looking at . oh , but because of this sale , they were out of stock phone on backorder . they could order it to be shipped to my house . it would take about days . days without a phone ? no . he suggested that i use an old one . i had no old one . he then convinced me that there was the exact same phone w o a keyboard . . and no one wanted the keyboard phones now they were becoming obsolete . he was skeptical at first , but he got used to the touch screen keyboard and was sure i would , too . ok , i relented , since i felt like i had to get something . i asked if i could get the free one as the other one on backorder and they just ship it to me . no , he said . n ni took the phone home , without instructions , figuring there must be a user guide there always was before . no . just a quickstart guide . not even a tutorial online . i had to ask my facebook friends how to do things . mos later , i still was having a hard time typing . i actually called a few months before that to ask the store if i could trade my other phone , never removed from the box , for the one i originally wanted . has it been more than days ? yes , i said . then , no , there s nothing you can do . so , i got so disgusted one day that i went online to chat with a cust svc rep online . he told me to call and even though the store couldnt do anything , cust svc could get me a different phone . i called . a very helpful guy told me that the stores have loaner phones and he should have offered me one of those until my phone came in . or , he could have offered to sell me a really cheap phone and return it in the day window . and , he most certainly could have given me the other phone as my nd phone and had it shipped to me . unethical of the salesman , but nothing cust service could do except recommend that i sell my other new phone on craigslist and use that to get an early upgrade approved by cust svc for the phone i wanted . fyi we had been verizon customers for years at this point . n ni chose not to do that . i chose to change cell phone companies with more ethical salespeople . i also called cust service later to ask them some question , and they asked me about my son s phone , and i said he can t use the data package , same as my env and so he never uses it . they said , you dont have to have the data package . if you block all data , we will cancel the fee for the data package ! apparently this had always been an option , but not one salesperson from verizon had ever told me this including the abovementioned unethical one who also activated the other env we had gotten from my son s aunt for him to have . enter this store if you need to purchase something at your own risk . if you re just looking , it should be ok . "
0,"it is much overpriced , and in my opinion the flavor and texture of the food was similar to what i would expect from any drive thru berto establishment . i don t mind that type of food when i m paying dollars and expecting to throw away a bunch of styrofoam . but dollars for two people for lunch and one drink each was money that could have been spent buying taco bell and a six pack of bottled margaritas , with money leftover for a tank of gas . the layout of the establishment is also really weird . and i m coming to notice that i have an issue with weirdly laid out restaurants , but i digress . you re practically knocking people s food over to get to a table in the back . but this isn t a place you d want that kind of attention . this place gets a star for the drink being huge and for the price , it should be and giving me a cool buzz on a saturday afternoon .

0,"i was not impressed . i had the pulled pork sandwich with mac cheese and waffle fries . the pork was dry , bun was soggy and the noodles in the mac cheese were hard . the waffle fries were good . we will not be back . "
0,"i don t know what it is about this restaurant that makes me keep coming back , even though i know i will hate the food and the service will probably be awful . yet , i keep coming back . is it because friends and family drag me to the first eatery they see when i meet up with them in lv or i m just growing senile and can t remember the things i ve done in lv so i don t remember the bad experiences i ve had at this place . in whatever case , i recommend going somewhere else . the service that some guests , even diamond stars guests , receive are laughable . the only plus is that they offer discounts for diamond stars guests . even then , i don t know if the discount on the food is worth it when one can barely stomach the food they serve . "
0," review is for milkshakes only came here because i ve heard a lot about the milkshakes , after looking at the menus in the bar lounge area we noticed the shakes weren t listed on there , we had to grab the hostess who was facing the dining room and talking to the other servers and ask if we can see a full menu . after agreeing we wanted to try some shakes we asked the hostess if we had to order in the dining room or if we could go to lounge area , she said we can sit at the bar , order to go or order at the bar . we sat in the lounge area and noticed we had to go back to the hostess stand to get a full menu . the hostess was still facing the restaraunt talking to the servers so i just went to her stand and grabbed the menu myself . by this point i was a little irritated but still wanted a milkshake . we ordered the fat boy and the vegan maple pecan , it took a while for shakes but after trying it , it was worth the wait . a few minutes later a runner came out and brought the leftover vegan maple shake , we were confused since we had our entire order , when we looked in what we thought was the vegan shake , it was actually a vanilla shake . so pretty much they delivered the extra leftover vanilla shake to a vegan . . . who drank it not realizing it was non vegan n ni understand there s a chance of getting non vegan items at a restaraunt that s not completely vegan but the entire experience was not worth it . good shakes though .

0,"by far the weakest establishments i was a part of a bachelor party and they denied us entrance i don t want to say it s because we were a group of black guys but that s what it feels like we had on tshirts and shorts and they said we can t come in based on dress code meanwhile they allowed a group of white guys dressed exactly the same but less swag entrance . , . i guess even if the money is green the man throwin it can t be black brown or anything else"
0,"do not go here . the customer service here is terrible . i have been to other aveda locations and never had as many issues as i have here and i feel like i gave them plenty of chances . ni got a groupon for aveda s ultimate stress relaxation package . this included sets of a massage , a blow out , and a manicure . n non i went to get my first set of this usr package . i got my massage and it was amazing ! the spa side of this facility is great . it s the hair and nail side that i have numerous problems with . i went to get my blow out and manicure and they were just awful . i have a lot of hair but at every salon i have ever been to takes minutes to cut my hair and at most minutes to style blow dry my hair . it took a girl and her friend yes two people an hour and minutes to style my hair . i asked for big curls i have very curly hair and i walked out with my hair straight , and my scalp practically bleeding . i do not have a sensitive but she just kept pulling and pulling and creating more knots that i almost started to cry . the same girl who started my hair also did my nails . she showed me a list of polishes and i picked out two that i liked , she couldn t find either of them so she just picked out ones that she liked and said that we would use those . she then proceeded to spill water all over me multiple times and take another hour and minutes to give me a manicure there was no cuticle removal , no nail cutting , very minimal filing and i could have painted them better myself . i spoke with her teacher and she was understanding on my frustration and said if it was a really big deal they could fix it , however i had already been there for hours and was starving . n non i attempted to give them another chance . i scheduled my second of three usr packages and began my appointment at my appointment time was , i was early i had a pretty decent massage and eyebrow wax . i spoke with her teacher , she was very nice and said she would pass my suggestions along . i was happy it was . i was taken over to the hair side and it all went down hill from here . i witnessed two teachers arguing over me because the spa side had ran over and they only had hours left to complete a blow dry and a manicure . i am not sure why it should take hours to complete both but apparently it was an issue . they then couldn t find a person to be my stylist because someone had taken a late lunch and didn t tell anyone . and yes they were loud enough to hear over all of the hair dryers and loud music in this place . they then assigned me with carlos i did not learn his name till later . he did not introduce himself or ask me if i wanted water . but had an awkward conversation about what services he thought he could do . nso we walked back to their nail area . the process they do is odd but i understand that it is a school so carlos takes about minutes to set up and find the nail polish that i had picked out and begins my manicure . i wanted so bad to have been wrong about aveda and their nail techniques but i was sadly correct . he gave me the worst manicure i have ever received , left my nails rough and had more polish on my skin than on my nails . this is also the conversation that took place during said manicure n ncarlos now it sounds like we are at the beach ocean sounds playing over the loud speaker it s like i am giving you a manicure outside in the sand nmeg that would be amazing , i could get tan and get my nails done at the same time ncarlos or you could get cancer . n none of the oddest conversations i have ever had with a stranger . by the time he had finished it was , i knew that if i had explained to him that the nails were bad i would not get the blow out that was part of my package so i let it go hoping to discuss it with his teacher just to have him get a little more education . he took me over to get my hair washed after complaining multiple times how long my hair was and began washing . he dropped the bottles on the sink causing the whole thing to vibrate and shake my head . he then started to do my hair with help from another student ashleigh she was extremely nice and asked me a ton of questions like they are supposed to . carlos never explained what he put in my hair or why . i asked for my hair to be strait because of last time and walked out with frizzy half dried hair because they were rushing to finish because they wanted to leave at exactly . n ni went to speak with a teacher on the way out about my nails . i said that my manicure was pretty bad and had more nail polish on my skin than my nails and without even looking up the teachers only response was well i guess he needs more practice and then shooed me out the door . no apology , no what can i do , nothing . n ndo not go here . its not worth the money you save because you just have to do it all on your own .

0,"i so wanted to like this place because i lover breweries . n ni can honestly say this might be the worst bar food i ve had in my life ! ! i think dog food right from the bag would be better . i had the roast beef and we split a pizza . i ve had better roast beef at subway . the pizza was ok , at best . n ni should have noticed because no one was eating . n nit s good for beer only . save your money on the food . n nit s not even in the same ball park as peaks . too bad . it would be nice to have more brewpubs in our area .

0,just brutal . they have a mandatory policy that waiting list has a minute wait to sit down . we came in as a party of five and they told us minute wait and we waited over minutes and tables were completely empty . we complained to the hostesses and manager and they didn t care at all . props to the servers we talked to as they were very annoyed they had empty tables when it was obvious there was people waiting .

0,"i wish i could give this store no stars . stopped in during a girls trip in december of last year to buy my boyfriend a christmas gift . it was during the day and i was dressed in comfortable clothes jeans , t shirt , and chuck s . the staff didn t say one word to me nor did they even acknowledge my presence in the store , which was obscenely overpriced for the quality . a gentlemen walked in wearing designer clothes and the staff was more than happy to greet and assist him . apparently , i didn t look like a serious buyer so the staff didn t give me the time of day . i work very hard and can afford to shop at a store like john varvatos but after my experience in las vegas i won t ever step foot into one of his judge mental stores again .

0,"in short avoid the steaks . n nwas there with a group last night , and had a poor experience generally . the wine beer list is varied , looks well curated , and is not overpriced though not cheap . i had half sweet tea which was a bit more tannic and less sweet than i would have expected , but still good . my wife had a good bottled cider . the pretzel sticks before the meal are a cute touch , and they work well . n nwe skipped appetizers , though we tried some of the lobster mac n cheese that a friend ordered and it was good . n nfor our entree we each ordered a steak , the spinalis medium for myself , and a filet rare for my wife . the spinalis is a tough cut to cook right , so the slight overdoneness can be forgiven , but it was also over seasoned and poorly trimmed . the steak sauce with which it was served is very one dimensional , and did not pair well with the arugula parmesan garnish at all . would avoid the sauce if you want to taste the beef . my wife s filet ordered rare was medium rare at the thicker end of the cut yes , a filet with a thicker end and was medium medium well at the thinner end . this imparted a chalky mouthfeel to what should have been a silky cut of beef . n nmy steak was served with fries , though i asked for the truffle parm fries . the fries were a sad portion , with a few full length fries that were cooked right , and the rest of the portion looked like the leftovers from the bottom of the fry basket short and burnt . the truffle oil was applied too liberally and smelled almost scorched . my wife s steak was served with yukon gold mashed in a cast iron skillet , and they were moist and delicious . would recommend the potatoes to other patrons . n ni had opportunity to try the dessert paired with the prix fixe vegetarian meal , which was a chocolate and berries cup with whipped cream . the cream was delicious and a great pairing in general , though the chocolate hunks should have been cut smaller they were three bite size . n ni imagine that you can have a delicious meal at zink , but when you re not precise with temperature , lack delicacy with seasoning , and are missing some small but noticeable details , it shows . if i were to return i would stick to easy to execute and more forgiving dishes like a burger .

0, star for me actually going to a different gas station and star for the cheaper gas at this station versus the one by my house . n notherwise yuck ! this place is dirty dirty dirty . i reached down to grab the gas pump handle and my hand almost got stuck to it because it was so sticky and gross . i know this is a gas station and those pump handles are gonna be dirty but i shouldn t have to bring gloves with me to get gas . n nthe trash was also overflowing at the pump . it looked like they never come outside and clean up . maybe it was too hot for them . n ni did not go inside and thank god . i can only imagine what that looked like . they should have a clean outside and it will be more inviting for people to go in and get other things . they are definitely losing money because of this who knows ? i may have went in and bought something if it was cleaner . 
0,"the service is super slow . . . . i was waiting for at least minutes for the good to come out . waitresses are also very slow , so i had to wait for quite a bit to pay my bill which was frustrating . . nthe prices and food are okay , though"
0,"my husband and i used to come here a lot since we found out about this place in summer of though we never really made effort to write a review until and now were back to revise that star we left . now were back with a two stars . things have changed over the summer . fajita mix was removed from the choices of fillers and prices went up as well . now they have added the option to be able to tip the employees which we don t mind but there is a new employee there , an elder lady who talks with so much enthusiasm trying too hard really and right when you get to the window to sign your receipt with a dollar and some change she just gives you the look and changed the tone of her voice . lady we can choose not to tip you know . nwe hardly come nowadays . sigh what happened to this place .

0,"scored to is worst is best n nalso , for those that say this is authentic . . . yes , they are right , authentic for disneyland . . . dont get me wrong , it s decor and looks and feel of the establishment is great and yes it is located to a mexican market but that doesnt make something authentic in my book . i have traveled all over in mexico and this doesnt cut it . it is a great place to take a tourist . . . in regards to the food , yes , they have authentic choices , but it s not stellar . n nmy opinion of authentic is that the food tastes like you are in puerto nuevo , cancun , mexico city and the flavor and smell is something you remember . only the environment here was memorable . if you didnt grow up with mexican food then i am sure this will be fine for you , but if you know what a carne asada burrito should taste like then keep looking elsewhere . n n atmosphere n n service n went on a friday at pm before dinner rush n n margaritas n n food n carne asada was your typical phx gummy and tough meat that is passes off as carne asada at most restaurants here in this city . the carnitas was link some pork tenderloin , and too salty . shrimp was very good , chips and dip was average , corn tortillas were excellent , beans and rice were average . n n mariachi trio n we have family that played for years , so we know good mariachis , and these guys were awesome . n n price n nso carne asada in phoenix is teh suck . . . i have yet to find something good . . .

0,"will not be ordering from here anymore . the food is good decent chinese , sushi isn t the best but it s fresh and they deliver so . . . n last time i ordered delivery i was quoted min , which is crazy fast but it normally is with them . i called after minutes to check up and was told that the driver was on the way . i called again after an hour and was hung up on . . . called back and was put on hold and forgotten . . . called back and spoke with someone who said they d check and see where the driver was and call me back . obviously no one called . n i called again and was told the driver was on the way , this is at an hour and minutes . the driver finally arrived after an hour and a half , no apology or offer from anyone to try and make it better . no one cared . n lost my business .

0,terrible . had more excuses as to why they didn t show up . put in new well pump . it only lasted a few years . have a feeling it was a used one . all he seemed to care about was talking about the nudist colony in new river . 
0,"my boyfriend and i stayed here over th of july weekend . n nyou couldn t pay me to ever stay at this poor excuse of a hotel again . n n nlet s begin with the pool n nwhen we first arrived friday day before check in we were allowed the option to enter the pool . there were of us in our double queen booked room . according to their policy only guests per room are allowed free entry to the pool , however , we were told our extra guest would be fine . once in line , and with the key card passes given to us by the front desk , the girl at the cashier informed us only people were allowed . so our friend paid , and that was that . however , she gave us free tickets for our pool towels apparently they charge you per towel for use at the pool , really ? . as well , be certain you have no needed medications or even tums in your purse or backpacks , as they will make you throw it away when they search you upon entry of the pool . so after being searched , we finally entered the pool area , to my amazement there were no chairs to lay out on or to put our towels down or any of our belongings . you have to rent a daybed if you want to lay out at their pool . seriously ? what kind of establishment has no chairs at their pool , charge you for a towel , and you have to sit on the wall of the pool for your seat , because supposedly it s a day club . they had a crappy dj . . . day club , my ! n nthe room n nafter waiting for the text to arrive that our room was available for us to check in , we did . the room was nicely decorated and seemed great at first glance . i must say the only thing good about this room was the bed , and that s it . our room was located next to the elevators , we went to bed fairly early as we were tired from the traffic . we were awoken several times throughout the night as noisy guests exited from the elevators speaking loudly the noise of heels could be heard clicking along the tile very easily , the walls are paper thin ! the windows sounded like they were open when they were closed must be single pane . hot water didn t get hot , just luke warm in the shower , and no coffee maker ! n n nthese things i could ve lived with and given the establishment at least stars . . . but the icing on the cake was the elevator and the customer service or lack thereof ! n nfriday night , on our way up to our room to go to sleep my boyfriend and i took the hotel elevator up to our room furthest from the entrance into the little alcove where the elevators are . expecting the regular normal ride , we were surprised when the elevator suddenly stopped . . . about seconds went by , nothing happened . . . and then bam ! it did a sharp and sudden drop it wasn t very long , all of half a second but enough to concern us and make us cling to the side railling . it stopped again and vibrated , concerned , we stayed close to the wall and the elevator again dropped . after the th time of this we begin to freak out we attempted to hit the call button . there was nothing but an automated voice , and then the call ended , we tried shouting for help but the elevator music was too noisy . after mins someone seemed to hear us , we think it was another guest , they said they d try to get help . all i have to say is that i ve never been so terrified in my life , this elevator was literally like the tower of terror , dropping without warning , and vibrating . . . we thought the cables were breaking loose ! at mins , there was one last sudden drop , and i burst into tears and was crying to my boyfriend that i wanted out and that this wasn t cool anymore , i literally questioned whether or not i was going to die on an elevator . two minutes later the doors miraculously opened at the casino floor where we had left off to go to our room which was up in the first place ! we both ran out of the elevator tears running down my face and hyperventilating mind you and the security that checks your room key looked at us bewildered . he asked , is everything okay ? we looked at him in disbelief , we stated , we were stuck on that elevator for twenty minutes ! you mean to tell us , that nobody knew ? ! ? the security person shrugged it off , and asked if we wanted to speak to someone else . . . um duh ! at this point , i was too upset to talk and i was still shaking from all the adrenaline in my system . a floor manager finally showed up , and asked us if we wanted to file a report . . . let me say , no one acted like it was a big deal that we were stuck on the tower of terror elevator for twenty minutes fearing for our lives ! their explanation was , oh , we have people working on the elevators right now , so that s probably why you were stuck their tone was essentially , what ? you don t get stuck on an elevator every day ? n nlong story short , they didn t care about our experience as guests there , we felt as though , they had their money and that was it . they let us file our report , and comped us one night of our stay for our troubles . worst customer service experience i have ever had ! "
0,"their reviews are over rated . i love a great french toast dish , so i was excited when i read the reviews . it was just ok , nothing to brag about , lacking in flavor . the wait for my food was much longer than it should have been , and they were not that busy . . . . . i had to ask for water twice . oj was best part of my breakfast . no one visited my table to ensure satisfaction . even at checkout hospitality was lacking . cute funky atmosphere tho . . . . . . . "
0,in the above review i said limited way too much observation
0,"arrived eager and excited to taste the food . ordered fresh spring rolls without pork and waitress verbally confirmed the order with no pork . the dish arrived shortly after the order was placed with pork in the spring rolls . after flagging down the waitress and having to explain the order that she verbally confirmed herself she was reluctant to bring the plate to the kitchen window . looking through the plate window which exposed the kitchen revealed a stack of pre made spring rolls waiting to be plated after they were ordered . the fresh spring rolls are not made to order and are left sitting like fast food under a heat lamp ! main dishes arrived with overcooked bloated noodles and non authentic broth . beef boullion is not an acceptable substitute in vietnamese noodle soup broth . further observation revealed blatant health code violations such as servers going into the kitchen and preparing handling food without washing their hands and employees using fingers instead of tissue to wipe their nose right before they handle food ! lastly , after asking a waiter to relay a message to the kitchen he admitted that there is a language barrier between the front of house staff and the kitchen crew they don t even speak the same language !

0,"i really wanted to like this place . it s close to my house and they offer typical diner comfort food that is familiar . plus they ve got a great theme , and the design and appointments inside really get you in the s mood . n nunfortunately the service is awful , the food is mediocre at best ! and the prices are absurd for what you get . for a country fried steak and two eggs ? ! . for a bleu cheese burger and by bleu cheese , they mean liquidy , running fluid that looks like bull semen . yuck . n nthe only plus is the . jukebox with classic s and s rock music . n nskip this place and hit either steiner s or charlie s nearby .

0,went to look for daughters first car and what an awful experience sales person was disengaged felt like we were doing him a disservice . will not be returning based on our visit if you go ask for someone other than dominque
0,"i spent a lot of time thinking about reviewing this place . i held off for a lot of personal reasons . i used to work here . but being unbiased . . . there are a few things i m bitter about but it s mainly with the owner . most of my friends refuse to deal with trader vic s because of me . but overall . . . . if you re on the strip it s easy to get to . but if you park in ph valet . . . not so bad . if you park in miracle mile parking . . . it s like a lord of the rings quest . ya if you don t know your way around you can walk in circles . when you get there , the hostess stand is in front and you can t tell if it s a restaurant . when you walk in , it s a little more posh than most other tvs . napps i like the coconut chicken . i hate the prices . i like the kahlua pork sliders . . . . but it s not kahlua pork . it s like pork in a sweet sauce . the food is not cheap . believe me for the quality and size of portions it sucks . lobster potstickers yum . satay is ok i mean i ve had authentic so when i taste this stuff , it s just ok . nmain courses my faves are usually the chef specials . they had ribeye once which was great . all in fried rice was good . not worth bucks but it s not bad . it s hard to say . i haven t been there since february so i don t remember the food . . . . so its kinda forgetable ? nbreakfast is good if they still serve it . the waffles yum . the stuffed french toast is amazing . . . . ndrinks i developed the wasabi mary . so of course yum . i also developed the coconut raspberry chocolate frappe . yum nmai tai is good if made right . originally they use fresh lime juice this place uses lemon concentrate for some reason . you have to order it from scratch otherwise they use a mai tai syrup for speed . most of the other drinks . taste the same all citrusy . the bowls eh can be worth it usually they have ounces of liquor in it . but its better between two people otherwise there s no point to getting a buzz . nso definitely one up on the view . but it s true this place is boring . they run out of liquor a lot . it s not fun like it used to be . eh . . . view one star , some drinks half star , some staff , half star .

0,"i buy my smokes at the little smoke shop next door , so if i need something small , i ll sometimes run in before heading home . n ntheir selection is pathetic . the few times i did shop there right after moving to the neighborhood , i d have to make a second stop somewhere else , because this store does not carry easily half of the staples in my kitchen . their meat and produce sections are worse than awful . i wouldn t take most of their selections if they were free , and to make it worse , their prices on their crappy produce is in line with whole foods . n nif i m grabbing sodas for a party , or a bag of ice , i ll accept their high prices for the convenience of it being around the corner from my house , or because i m already in the parking lot , but i ll never do an actual grocery shopping trip here again . n ndo yourself a favor . make the drive to flamingo and sandhill . the smiths there has a much better selection , better produce , better meat selection , better bakery , better prices , and friendlier staff .

0,"i think you already know the facts ntiny portions , overpriced , slow nthe decor is cool , and i like the linq in general , but i thought it would be different than going to casino restaurants . don t be fooled . it s just like mandalay place or the forum shops . if you want to walk from shops to bars to restaurants , east fremont is still your best bet .

0,"this is one of those unfortunate luxury hotels that had not yet learned that a bad experience based on a flawed policy can ruin the stay . n nthey purport to be a child friendly place with a high level of customer service , yet my experience was to the contrary . i lost an item my jacket and they gave me the run around for almost two hours , claiming that this person would help me , and then that person , with no one actually assisting me . meanwhile my three children and their grandmas sat in the cold in our cars we were ready to leave to return home , trying to beat the traffic . they ultimately claimed no one in the hotel had access to lost and found during this two hour window . i received three different stories about how the lost and found system operates . i kept asking why we couldn t have someone just escort me to the lost and found area so i could quickly identify my jacket , and i got no answer other than it was against policy . i also kept asking why someone couldn t just run up there and bring it back to me . this apparently was also against some policy . it was only after i became vocal about my frustration that someone from the housekeeping department finally said she would go look , but she said it would take minutes to locate it . . . ? ? n none gentleman from security was extremely rude , actually criticizing me for not making a report to lost and found sooner . i came to the hotel with a husband , three small kids , two grandmas , and my brother in law , so it was a busy trip . i only realized it was missing the same morning i reported it . when i told him that he and the hotel were being disrespectful of our family situation by not finding a way to retrieve my jacket , he actually rolled his eyes . n ni asked to speak to manager about the situation , and was told she would not speak to me , because she was in a meeting . she then ultimately came out to the front desk and didn t say a word to me . n nit was truly an unbelievable experience , and sullied our five day stay here . n npeople come to hotels like this for the customer service and hospitality , and this place fell short . there are other smoke free hotels with a much higher level of service available . it is too bad because it is an aesthetically pleasing property with some great aspects . there is this great heated pool , and the housekeepers on our floor were a delight . there is a lovely little spa . the valet attendants were true professionals .

0,"my husband and i love pho . we are new to the area and have been trying out different restaurants . last weekend we decided to try this place for lunch . the one star is for the awful service . we were seated fairly quickly , but it was at least minutes before we were brought menus . we waited another minutes and still no water , no one to take our order . . . nothing . the restaurant was steady but not busy . the employees seemed to be completely unengaged . i can t remember the last time we walked out of a restaurant , but after waiting close to a half an hour we decided to cut our losses and try another place . we ended up at saigon pho , which was wonderful excellent food and service ! there are too many great places to eat in the phoenix area to ever give this place a try again . "
0,"i have heard a lot of good things about five guys so i decided to try it out . i ordered two burgers , two fries , two drinks , and a hot dog and was shocked by the price . over . is ridiculous in my opinion . i figured it must be really great but that assumption was wrong . it tasted like any other burger and hotdog out there . the best part were the cajun fries . the order took about minutes , which was also ridiculous . if i am going to wait that long when there are only other tables occupied , it had better be amazing . very disappointed in the price and taste . other fast food places are far better . "
0,"super slow ! ! ! been here x and they never get my order right ! ! ! will never come back here ! i always ordered well done fries and i always get saggy fries that probably been sitting around for more than an hour . i went to go to drive thru and the lady told me to wait minutes at front parking lot minutes later still nothing so i decided to go drive at the drive thru . the lady told me to go back to the front and wait minutes i told her i ve been waiting for minutes . they so slow ! ! ! and probably not even doing their job . i own the business across the street and they always waste my time . today , i asked for that oreo mcflurry i think and they said yes they have some so it s cool , then when i went to pay , they told me i m sorry we don t have some at the moment and we will refund your money and you can take the rest of your order at the nd window whoever the manager here for sure doesn t know how to manage . i hope mcdonalds pay attention to this location . they need better people inside ! ! !

0,"only stars , because the food was amazing . just terrible service . starting off on the wrong foot . our server literally threw the coaster at my father . he was so irrate and ready to throw it right back at her , we had to calm him down . i told her , you can get away with throwing coasters possibly to the younger people at the table , but my father doesn t like that , and i asked her not to do it again . i still tipped her well . i will go again , but i know my parents never will . next time i am also going to speak with the manager . "
0,"for the location and the price , i was honestly expecting a lot more . we go to vegas an average of times a year , so i ll boast that i m only slightly past novice status as an lv hotel goer . n nrooms were well worn , the windows were dirty and unpleasant to look out of , and the customer service at the front desk was slooooooow , inept , and befuddling . i d booked on priceline more than hours in advance , but they couldn t find any record of my reservation , which turned into a weird bait and switch of having me pay full after i had already been charged by priceline . funny how those things never work out in your favor . eventually it worked out they found my reservation , but not after a headache . took a half hour to check in , so priceliners , tread with caution . n nhighlights of the luxor are the pool and the spiked slushies daiquiris . that said , you re able to experience these things without staying in the actual hotel , which is what we ll do in the future if we ever return . n nstay off strip in a place that gives you real bang for your buck , and come here to party if that s what brings you here in the first place . it ll be a little bit harder to get back to your room when you re shmammered , but aren t those the kinds of stories that las vegas is all about ? "
0,"umm . . . no . . . n nthis place is ghetto and not in a ghetto supastar kinda way . n nwe waited in line to sign up for their players card so we could get some free plays while indulged in cocktails . the line was long and we signed up for the card , we received our fun book which was printed double sided papers . they should call it fun paper instead of fun book . totally misleading . n nthen we headed to special slot machines for our free plays . i know this would be totally waste of time , but it was really bad . those machines were broken and the best part was the cocktail waitress just skipped us . she took another couple s order who sat beside us and i even signaled her that we would like to order cocktails . she literally just passed us . n nwe left and will never come back . there are better casinos in vegas .

0,"i went into this shop and bought an onion and some other stuff . the chap asked me if that was the only onion and i say just one ion wun ee un and he didn t laugh or high five me . therefore i feel unable to score this place highly . n nother than that it s a pretty decent if rather expensive shop that i only goto if drunk or if tescos is closed for some horrid reason . the fruit and veg is generally fairly rubbish , but they usually have some decent reduced to clear things if you re looking for inspiration . i once got about kg of gammon steak for about u a . n nother than that it s usually got a beggar outside , someone trying to steal things inside , and noone is really sure how to queue . "
0,"our first time here , came with a few of my buddies . we were checking out the place , it s huge with a lot of things to do . you would think that the bowling or laser tag hostess will be social and talk to everyone but instead they are rude and like to only socialize with one another . our server josh was really nice however , he changed the experience . he was really patient with us , but the bowling host didn t explain anything to us , just told us what the price was and sent us on our way and not to mention she wasn t too nice , same with the obstacle course and laser tag host . we traveled a long way to see this place and only had one good experience . "
0,"i knew i should ve trusted fellow yelpers . even though pink s didn t get very good reviews i still went there and tried one of their hot dogs . we tried their chili dog , and were very disappointed . the dog had no flavor at all . it tasted like nothing , if that s even possible . the chili was just okay . nothing that would enhance the dog s flavor , but it didn t make is taste any worse . not only was it lacking flavor , but the hot dog was also quite expensive . for one ! wouldn t recommend or visit this place in the future . my advice , just skip this place and go somewhere else .

0,"we came here for sunday brunch , and ordered things . n nleroy s buttermilk skillet cornbread just one slice . chicago downtown s bandera restaurant used to have a whole mini skillet for this price x the portion of this , the price has since gone up . with the word skillet , we assumed it would came in a full skillet even a small one , but nope ! taste wise nothing to write home about , the bread is just so so . marmalade added a nice kick to it though . n nmigas pulled pork eggs benedict both were not too bad each came with a small side of their house potatoes . the deep fried house potatoes were delish . portions of the main entree were enough , but the side potatoes was on the lighter side , almost too little . n nservice at pm on a sunday was a little slow the place was fairly filled up , still , it seemed like they had a good number of servers , so this was a little disappointing . n nnice ambient , but can get very noisy . n nour overall rating of the restaurant is star .

0,"this place is horrible . i am filipino and this place puts me to shame . i ate here with my family one day and the service was slow and the food sucked . the server never got my order right and served me cold food . the boba drink i ordered should have been my first sign because it was so bland and was not blended to the right consistency . the server never even checked up on us after and we were polite and his only table in the place . . . . this place is an utter disappointment , so if you want the crappiest service and horrible food this place is for you .

0,"i cam to total wine with my girlfriend , to buy some rum . i had my id , and she didn t . i went to the register to pay for the rum , and they wanted to card both of us , though i was buying it for myself . since only i had my id , we couldn t buy the rum . if they don t want to serve customers , i have no reason to come here . do not recommend .

0,"trying so hard to be hip like the cosmopolitan , ends up being more overdesigned like the rumor boutique hotel . quirky details everwhere which are whimsical but not pulled together . a cleopatra picture here , an exposed bulb lighting fixture there , a wood table here it just ends up being wierd . their logo is drunken monkeys on a chandelier . yep that about sums it up drunken monkeys stealing mirrors and forks stressful . very chaotic . very tightly packed casino floor with restraunts and clubs lining the outside tons of murals and graffiti walls . the ugliest casino carpet i have ever seen with writing that i can t make out what it says . i ate at umami burger . had the vegetarian sloppy joe , shoestring fries and a soda water good but ! was excited for a hotel opening but will not be back . they only want the ca kids it seems . the pool looked nice . maybe i would come back for that one day .

0,food is mediocre service is lousy . i m sitting here right now and have been out of water and done eating for min . . . 
0,"i came here once on a date , when i was new to the area , thinking that since this place is in shadyside it would be fairly trendy . n non the contrary , the atmosphere was awful , i felt like i was in a cheap diner . the plates glasses chop sticks all felt cheap . i was surprised they served drinks , but their mixed drinks were awful . n nthe sushi was actually better than expected for such an awful looking place , and from what i recall it was fairly fresh . they did serve all of our sushi on one plate , and it felt really crowded and sort of took away from the taste of it . n ni keep thinking i may go back with a buddy just to get some sushi and give it another shot , but the atmosphere really takes away from the food , so i doubt i will come back .

0,this is a typical asian supermarket upon entering . that s what i thought till i started to wander around . the live fish tanks were just down right gross . they were dirty and the fish didn t look fresh . walked around some more and stumbled across their bakery deli area . this here was the breaking point . the cake case had some really old cakes . you could tell by the dried out strawberries with the black edging . n ndon t shop here and get your goods from the other market in this strip . 
0,"we were seated fairly quickly , and received drinks shortly after . but then it took almost an hour to receive the food . it was not that busy in there when we first got there , but within minutes the place was packed with people waiting to be seated . overall the service could have been better but was not the worst experience .

0,"so after our first visit we came back , unfortunately this time was terrible . we were served our salad and there was a rock in mine which when i bit down on chipped my tooth ! the manager said she had to call security , no apology nothing , as if i had made this up ! minutes later we are sitting here still waiting for security . . . . . . . .

0,"one year ago my mother in law visited affordable to have a re alignment done . at the time they did the realign and she asked dr . chang if dental implants would be a good fit for her . dr . chang did an eval , and came back saying yes they would be a suitable option for you . at that time they were walk in only so my mother in law had that in mind when she headed over there this morning to get her lower plate implant done . you had to be there at am sharp and they took you in first come , first served . n nunbeknownst to us this practice changed from walk in to appointment only in october . rather than communicate this change with their customers they didn t bother to send out any type of communication so they left us hanging a bit . this morning my mother in law and all of us head over there at am sharp and am told that sorry , dr . chan is out on vacation to get married and her replacement is not qualified to do the procedure that was needed . n nneedless to say this is not cool as we ve been planning for this since january , time off work was scheduled and she wanted to have a long holiday weekend to recover . but all that got tossed out the door by a practice that quite simply failed to communicate with their customers about a core business policy change . n ni have had other doctors dentists in denver and kansas city make changes like this and what did they do ? they did a snail mail email blast and even phone calls to alert everyone . doing so engages your customers , it keeps them in the know and most importantly coming back . while dr . chang has a great reputation , the failure of her front back office staff just cost her customer today , and at least others in the near future . not cool people , not when i know that others in the same profession know how to communicate and avoid situations like this . it s crap like this that continues to sully las vegas s medical reputation . n nwhile we re all peeved over here when you can get to dr . chang she does do good work . that s the only thing preventing a star zinger of a review .

0,"you re better off going to chompies down the street . service here sucks , food is average at best . at one point i noticed the manager come out and grope one of the waitresses . every time i come here i am more disappointed . "
0,"went here for lunch . . . . and you get what you pay for . it wasn t completely awful . we came in hungry and left full but i don t think we will be a repeat patron . n noff the bat the place is inexpensive . . . . definitely the most affordable buffet i ve seen in a while . however , the atmosphere isn t as great . it s not as clean as i would have wanted . . . we opted for a table instead of a booth because the clean booths were sticky all over seats , table , everything . n nsecond observation the smell . i couldn t pin point it . didn t know if it was the smell of uncleanliness or bad food . . . . until we noticed that they were cooking menudo . yucky yucky smell . n nthird variety of pizza was initially poor . i m pretty much a vegetarian and there were no options for me . sausage pizza , pepperoni pizza , taco pizza yes , taco , bacon pizza um , ewww . i thought that at a pizza restaurant a cheese pizza would have been easy to come by . n nyou are , however , able to request pizzas which saved the experience . they had a quick turnaround for fresh pizzas . . . . so i got a cheese pizza , veggie pizza , and spinach alfredo pizza . they weren t to die for but you can t have high expectations when paying for all you can eat . n nsalad bar didn t have fresh salad . . . . everything was frozen . and they got a little too creative for the dessert pizzas strawberry glob with hershey syrup is no bueno . n nall in all . . . . not awful but you definitely get what you pay for here .

0,"it gets the job done . and by that i mean you have all the basic amenities like bed , lamp , toilet , shower , and a locking door . what else do you need in vegas ? r nwell , actually it would be nice to have a door that doesn t spill light through all sides when you want to sleep past sunrise . and more than a teenytiny bottle of shampoo suave , by the way . and an air conditioner that doesn t smell something vaguely like urine . r n r ni ve been in a worse hotel in vegas . so , it s more like . stars . on the lower end of most best westerns . and i ve been to a lot . r n r nand the location keeps it under four stars it s off the strip behind the new wynn hotel s golf course . but it is right next to the monorail system excellent .

0,"unfortunately there is nothing special about this place . my husband got the french dip and myself the mushroom panini . mine was rather disappointing , the mushrooms were minced so tiny and the flavor was semi reminiscent of canned cream of mushroom soup . . . . on a sandwich . i hate leaving bad reviews but it wouldn t help anyone if i lied , sorry .

0,"i sort of hate to give this spa only two stars , since the facilities are gorgeous . we had a lovely day here the rooftop pool is nice , and we really enjoyed the indoor and outdoor jacuzzis . a minor annoyance was the fact that about half of the seats at the pool were cabana style , and were pay only . given how expensive the spa is , it felt grubby to be asked to also pay for a cabana at the pool . even more annoying was at first there weren t enough lounge chairs , and even though of the cabanas were empty , we weren t allowed to sit there . i saw some people perching at the side of the pool on a towel they didn t look comfortable . n nthe real reason for the low stars is that the treatments were mediocre . i had a deep tissue massage and my friend had a regular signature massage and both were lame . i can t speak to the details of hers , other than her disappointment , but mine was sort of a joke the masseuse hit the exact same spot in my mid back over and over so i got some deep tissue on this one place and nowhere else . he also had one or two bizarre techniques i could sense his arms moving rapidly wildly that accomplished nothing , and he didn t get into my upper shoulders at all . he also spent at least minutes of the draping me , adjusting the bed , moving towels around , etc . it felt like too much wasted time . i don t need my leg perfectly wrapped just dig into my muscles , please . n ni ve had amazing messages at the setai in ny , the wynn in vegas , etc . , so i know what to expect and what a good deep tissue massage is . this was not . i feel a little bad since the guy was nice , but when you re paying for a treatment , it should be amazing .

0,the yellow tail tuna sashimi was ok . but the crab roll sushi rice looked like rice from the previous night . it was dry and didn t taste fresh at all . it was edible and thankfully didn t taste stale at least ! ! ! n nthe chicken fried rice barely had any flavour in it . the chow mein was the best of the lot but that wasn t saying much really . the sweet corn chicken soup was ok but was really thick and a tad too starchy . n noverpriced and not worth it . not going there again . 
0,i pre ordered pokemon games . each game comes with a pokemon figure for the pre order . went to pick them up the day it was released and they wouldn t give me the figures because they were not given enough from the supplier . wth ? tell that to my year old . they told me to call back in a few days since they never have pick up and they were only giving them to the people that order on the st day of the pre order . if this happens all the time they should tell you at pre order . called tonight no extra figurines and the games are in stock . 
0,"i typically visit this mcdonald s and am a regular due to the playland , my daughter and the arizona heat . as of late , they have been completely lacking in the customer service end . my latest visit left me quite displeased . i waited mins for my order and when it finally was ready , my frys were missing . after pointing out the issue , i had to wait an additional minutes . i got over it , big deal . but then my daughter asks me for an icecream cone so i go to order . as i approach the register another patron enters and is behind me . when this happens the manager and employee completely overlook me standing there placing my order and service the patron after me . at this point i am shocked and appauled . i decide to express my frustration to the assistant manager who offer me a very lackluster apology . avoid this place if you can help it .

0,i come to the auto center since my car battery is under warranty here . i needed to change my battery because my car died that day and my warranty expires this month . i felt lucky at first arriving at a nonbusy time . little did i know it would take them a whole hour just to get my car keys back so the guys could work on my car ! it was like dealing with dumb and dumber ! neither of them knew what they were doing . they were confusing each other and talking crap about the work issues they have there . they kept telling me i had the wrong battery size and had to do an exchange now which requires a manager . the manager had zero personality . seemed like nothing in their computers were working right . the guy had to scan my car battery at least xs . they said the battery they gave me was larger but said i wouldn t need to pay a difference . in all their confusion the cashier guy handed me . . . i m pretty sure i was not due credit . . ugh ! last time here ! 
0,"ugh seriously wth n ni went in , looked around and didnt see what i needed . i asked the girl behind the counter it took them a while to have anyone come up front , but i could hear them bsing around in the back ! n ni asked if they had what i needed . she looked at me and said i dont know , do we ? ni was like wtf . . . i am asking you ! ni would have bought a few hundred bucks of car crap . but i left .

0,"went in this afternoon to buy some water for the drive back to la . they had two liter dasani bottles advertized for . . i also wanted a small paper cup to hold a few ice cubes for my three year old in the car . an employee named elvia initially tried to charge me over dollars for the water . when i called her on it , she rang me up at an even . . she told me i was being charged for using their cup for ice . not wanting to argue and because i needed to be back in la by a certain time and was in a hurry , i just paid her and left . small drink with their paper cup is cents , add sales tax it should be about . , yet she somehow reached an even . . naturally she did not offer me a receipt to justify this purchase nor to document her actions . not wanting to waste time arguing with her over a buck fifty , i left knowing that this arco employee had every intention of ripping off its customer . i hope she enjoyed her chump change because i won t be going to this arco or any arco ever again if they allow employees like this to work for them . again , this particular employee is named elvia , a shorter latina woman with short hair , late s to early s . she wasn t even polite about it , which may have made the gouging tolerable . i do encourage all vegas tourists and locals to choose any other filling station aside from this one .

0,"service felt really rushed and my smoothie was super chunky . n nplus , instead of filling the cup all the way up , the guy just sloshed a bit in the cup and then slapped the lid on . n nthen he threw the rest of the smoothie away . n num . i think i ll just not go to this jamba juice again . "
0,"i ve been coming here for awhile and they usually do an okay job . typically i opt for the protect and shine package and add interior dressing for the back of my suv because of my dogs . thy dont usually charge much for this add on if anything at all ! today i decided to get the ultimate which includes interior exterior dressing . after about an hour i got my car back and they didn t even wipe out the back or the doors or anything and when i mentioned it to the guy he said they don t do that ! come to find out , they only wipe off the dash ! after all that time and money and being a loyal customer x a month for two years they treat me like that . and when i got home i realized they stole all the change out of my cup holder ! ! ! i am never going back !

0,"i m torn ! i should give this place but gonna give it instead . the first time i ate here was for lunch . i had one of their lunch specials shrimp in lobster sauce or something like that and the bf ordered crispy chicken without whatever sauce they slather over it . all was mediocre . the servers were nice friendly and the space was clean . i really wanted to like this place . it was close to home and finding a conveniently good chinese place is a heaven sent . not too long ago i got sick . i was craving for a nice bowl of wor wonton soup . i called in the order for two people not for the bf but thinking of the next day so selfish ! . the bf picked it up on his way back from the gym . i was extremely excited to dive in this broth of life . it was far from bringing me back to life . the broth was flavorless ! i could do hellah better with packaged ramen ! ! there were . . . hmmm . . . let s see . . . all of two wontons in the whole soup . glad the order was for two wonton for today , for tomorrow ! also , i swirled my spoon round n round and around again looking for some crustaceous morsels . i thought out loud to the bf that shrimp should come in the soup . for buckaroos , he said it better comes in a school of em . does school applies only to fish ? anyhow , they did their math correctly though there s shrimp to go with the wonton for today and the other shrimp to go with the wonton tomorrow . btw , i m a queen of doctorin up flavorless dishes , but this bowl of soup was a loss cause . i m still trying to recover from my flu . go figure ! "
0,"this place deserves more stars for their food , but their service was so horrible that i can t bring myself to go higher than . n nat first , all seemed well . quick service for the menu , drinks and soup eggroll that came with my lunch special by the way , a great deal for all the food you get . n nbut after i got my drunken noodles very tasty , i never saw the waitress again . even though i made a point to put my empty glass at the edge of my table , my eyes begging for a refill each time she walked by , but she was just too busy to bother . i eventually gave up on the hope of getting more soda and finished my meal and again , trying to give a signal that i m ready for my bill , pushed my empty plate to the edge of the table . she rushed back and forth a few times and glanced at the empty plate and glass , but still not bothering to stop by . n ni eventually got up and walked over to the other waitress at the computer station and told her i wanted to pay . very frustrating to say the least . n nthe food is great but the service ruined the experience for me . sadly , i will not be returning here . you can find me at thai rama in chandler instead .

0,"i d heard several people rave on about spoon and decided to finally visit when with my mother after she helped me move into a new flat nearby . i was initially impressed with spoon . it was a large spacious cafe bistro , with interesting pictures with chairs imprinted with maps and pages from comics . it had a sort of a tidy bits and bobs feel . i was also impressed by the friendly waitress . it was a big improvement from the chinese buffet house that used be here . n nfrom then on it went downhill . the menu was small , which isn t necessarily a bad thing , but there was little for vegetarians . i wanted to have soup with something else but my only options were basically soup with mushrooms or some mushroom quiche . in the end i just went with the soup . hoping it would be enough to at least temporarily fill me up , i was given one of the measliest bowls of soup ever with a little slice of bread . it tasted okay , all two sips of it . maybe this place is named after its maximum portion size . a spoonful . i had heard this place was inexpensive one of the reasons i was excited for what you got but it wasn t , and my wallet was all the lighter for it . n nwhat i thought was a simple , cheap place to grab some filling lunch was a disappointing experience . i left almost as hungry as when i went in . n nthe only other problem about this place is you are only allowed to eat with spoons . nothing else . even the steak . spoons only . okay that s a lie . but i do feel like i might as well have pocketed some of the cutlery with me to make up my money s worth . n ni have since heard from others that this place has gone down hill a bit , that it used to be cheaper and the portions bigger . maybe the recession hit it hard . maybe it will improve again . maybe i will try again one day and just ask for coffee .

0,"we stopped in during our vacation in las vegas , on the recommendation of several friends who had been there in the last to years . it was a disaster , being too expensive and the food was terrible . plus , it seemed that there was some ingredient in the food that made us feel full . we usually eat times what we did at this international buffet . n nfirst , we had to get instructions , from a woman , who told us that we had to go to a kiosk and get a ticket . the ticket told us , that we had to wait minutes , before we could get in the line to buy into the international buffet . . we were in that line for minutes , before we got to the teller that wanted . per person to eat at the international buffet . took us at least minutes to pay her . so after hours we finally got to our seats and started to get some food . i waited at the table while the other went and got food , no one approached me during that minute wait . they looked happy about their selection , so off i went to find something to eat . so hours and minutes later , i m searching for food . n nsecond , walking down the food line , i searched through the crowd for items i might be interested in , not much caught my eye . after walking almost a block and half , i got to the beginning of the food line . picked out some beef pepper steak , scalloped potatoes , some green beans , crab rangoons , fried asparagus and waffle wrapped chicken . got back to my seat after minutes of walking the food line . now , hours and minutes have passed . the beef pepper steak , green beans and fried asparagus were all cold . scalloped potatoes were tasty and hot . the crab rangoons had no crab in them , just cream cheese . the waffle wrapped chicken was hot , but the waffle part tasted awful , l so i peeled it off the partial chicken breast piece and ate the hot tasteless chicken . my friends had each gotten some sliders , which weren t there when i walked through , they said that the sliders were good . they also got some prime rib , of which , one got some almost raw meat and the other had to have it cooked a lot more . i couldn t get any prime rib on the first time through , as too many people were crowding the station . they each also got some cheese sauce covered chicken breast filets , they said they were good . there weren t any either time i walked the food line . a waitress had brought drinks to the table while i was away . as i was eating my friends went back through the food line and came back to the table with some other food . then i went a second time to get some food . there were some sliders , this time , and i was able to get some prime rib , which was now cooked a lot more . as i was leaving the meat window , they brought out some hot sweet potato tots which were great hot . got some watermelon too . my friends didn t eat much of what they got the second time , complaining of being full . i ate my prime rib , which was tender , but tasteless , after salt and peppering it , i managed to get it down before it went cold . by this time my sliders were cold and the meat was raw , so i didn t eat them . i was starting to feel full too . i ate my watermelon and my friends went and tried some desserts , which there were unable to finish because of being too full . while i was getting my second plate , a waitress came by and left some receipts for the sodas at . each . on the receipt was a note that we were requited to limit our dining experience to hours . each time they refilled our glasses we got more and more ice and less and less soda . n nthere were mashed potatoes and gravy , kinds of pizza , crab legs , muscles and shrimp on ice and all sorts of breads . i think that there were baked potatoes , but not sure . they had oyster shooters and some salad makings . i could not find any hot shrimp dishes , either breaded fried or stir fried with or without veggies . maybe hot warm shrimp is a supper item . n nin conclusion , we got charged . of us for waiting in line for hours and minutes to eat terrible cold food and raw meat and be filled up on eating so much less food than either of us was used to eating . i would recommend that you skip this international buffet and go anywhere else . if you like cold crab legs and cold muscles , i recommend getting a caesar s player s card or a buffet of buffets pass . at least your culinary disaster will be cheaper than ours .

0,only one star because stars isn t an option i arrived late due to nightmare traffic on i and nearly everything was closed . despite my deeply held loathing for papa john s issues with them honoring their own coupons i called them anyway to order two cheese pizzas for pickup . i was informed that i could wait minutes for delivery but couldn t drive there and pick them up . huh ? i was told its a safety issue . but it s perfectly safe to send drivers out at night ? morons . they just confirmed everything i hate about papa john s . i ve never wanted to see a company go out of business so badly as i do papa john s . 
0,"this is an overpriced tourist trap filled with chain everything . . . the only thing that i liked about this place was that it was attached to jobing . com arena , cardinal stadium and they had outdoor entertainment performers . . . ohhh and the cremation advertisement was pretty funny as well . n nif you want to go to a game here parking is partially free during games . however in some areas it is or more ! ! ! yeah i was totally surprised by this . . . so if you show up early , its free , if you dont you pay ! this mall is multiple stories of restaurants , shops , a theater , and who knows what all else . n npro tip avoid this place unless you are going to a game here . . . n nthis place is also good for one last thing , people watching . i was laughing pretty hard as a couple of girls wearing lingerie and fishnets strolled by on their way to a bar . what was super funny was they were not the type of ladies you would want to see wearing lingerie and fishnets out and about in public . perhaps this is the only city around where this is not out of the norm and no one , i repeat no one did a double take . n nseriously phoenix and its surrounds are super unique and have some very humerus moments to say the least . so keep your eyes peeled if you come here and if not , count yourself pretty dayem smart . . . the restaurant i went to here really sucked as well . . .

0,i couldn t wait to stop by zara when i was in town but what a disappointment for me . first of all the clerks need a lesson in customer service . not once did anyone offer to help me as i browsed around the store multiple times . n ncan t say i was all that impressed with the merchandise either . maybe i just caught this place on a bad day but i sure won t hurry back to go shopping here anytime soon . 
0,"just moved back to las vegas after living in a rural area near a lot of farms . n nwe also got very used to farm fresh eggs versus the ones you can buy in the store , so upon learning that the farm sells eggs led to an early saturday morning trip . n nwe were greeted by someone at the gate collecting a . per person admission charge . i very politely advised her that i had no intention of paying for the privilege of then shopping at their farm stand . n nthis same person then needed to find out if our dog was allowed into the store , however after a very brief discussion it was agreed that a leashed dog was allowed into an area full of chickens , cows , pigs and other farm animals . n nwalked around the shop which is somewhere between kitschy and cluttered before finding the eggs , which were selling for per dozen . despite the price , we decided to buy two dozen eggs and then browsed the remainder of the farm stand . n neverything we found was overpriced and not up to the quality we expect from a farm stand farmers market . n nended up leaving with only the eggs and some honey . over the next few weeks , we have found the eggs to be full of blood spots , which indicate that the hens are older and well past their egg laying prime . while edible , it is not what we expect from farm fresh eggs , especially for the price . n nwe have found better eggs on craigslist , and for far less money . n nwill never return to the farm to buy anything . n nif you have small kids and want a sanitized and commercial farm experience for them it may be worth a trip . otherwise , just take a trip to to real farm land it isn t that far from here .

0,"food was ok , but service was terrible . our server never came back to our table to check if we need another drink , water , bread , etc . we had to get somebody else s attention for our need . at the end , they included tipping which is their policy for or more people . we just wanted to let them know she did not provide us service enough for tipping . when we called the manager , he was worse . he said , did you get your food ? did you get your drink ? then what is your problem ? i am missing your point . four of my friends came from japan . they totally ruined our time .

0,"i used to go to the paymons by unlv fairly frequently when i lived on that side of town . my boyfriend and i were in the market for a new happy hour to check out , so i found this place on my mobile app . regretting it greatly now . nfirst regret , the specialty cocktails . margaritas were ridiculously too sweet , and i read through the ingredients . they use a mix i have used before , so i m not sure how those got screwed up . . . and i m a bartender . nnext , we ordered the hummus as a starter , and it arrived surprisingly fast . downside however was it was depressingly bland and oozy , not thick or flavorful at all . we figured oh well , the entrees should make up for it . ni ordered the gyro pita , accompanied by athens fries , my boyfriend got the pesto pizza . i couldn t pick up the thing , cuz it would probably fall apart , so i proceeded to make little mini pitas by tearing pieces of it and putting the meat , tomato , onion and tzatziki sauce inside , very messy . i now realize that we were never given settings or napkins . since my boyfriend had to go looking for our server a couple times , i said to hell with it and got some paper hand towels from the bathroom . my server saw me come back with said towels , and said nothing to us or checked in still . nback to the food . i couldn t put my finger on it , but something was way off with the gyro meat , a little too chewy i suppose , and barely warm . . the fries weren t really anything to write home about . my boyfriend said his pizza was basic and bland also . nthe only time server finally checks on us , he rudely interrupted my boyfriend and i having a moment . we asked for a box and the check . in all honestly the only reason for the box was to give the food to the dogs . nthe check arrived , and we were thrown for a loop . i have no problem paying for a quality fare , but we were under the impression that most of our items were on happy hour pricing . nope . drinks , hummus , pizza and my gyro came out to bucks , wtf . i then got on here and learned that happy hour pricing was only on tuesday nights . another thing i came across in these reviews was that weds nights are customer appreciation night and they take off the final check . again , didn t happen . nwe were over it at this point and just wanted to vacate . again , my boyfriend had to go looking for our server , who he said gave him an irritated look when we needed change . i always leave as i am in the industry , and can understand that not all issues are the service staffs fault . in this case i ll admit i lowballed . nto make it even better , as we were getting some stuff at the gas station on the way home , i rapidly became unbearably nauseas and ran outside to throw up . definitely won t be caught here again , i don t even think i feel safe giving the hounds the food anymore . . . that s bad .

0,"food was mediocre and the rental rates for a room to sing karaoke were pricey . it took the waitress a bit to get drinks so the buzz never really sunk in . an empty glass in a bar is a waste . not overly generous on the booze either . two hours and later , i was only slightly buzzed , as was my friend , so we decided to trek over to the grapevine .

0,"i really wanted to like frank oak . i noticed their advertisements several times and finally made a purchase before starting a new job . my experience was awful . i ve never been this mistreated by any online store apparel or others . n nmy order took days to ship . not days to receive at home , but days to receive an email with shipping confirmation . granted it came days later , which is an acceptable shipping time , but total days before having the items i ordered in hand is no good . and this is after an email and phone call to customer support without a response . i would be more understanding of business issues if they were able to communicate with customers . i also had one item unshipped because it was out of stock and only found this out when receiving the package no out of stock warning on the site or email of any sort . n nin terms of quality , the clothes i ordered were below expectations . i decided to try a button down and pair of dress pants but didn t even put the items on after finally receiving them because they were so thin i knew i would be returning immediately . now i m trying to get out of the hunt club that i was tricked into signing up for but still cannot get a hold of customer service . n ndon t waste your time spend a few extra bucks on banana , bonobos , j . crew , etc .

0,"maybe i went there on an off day . maybe there were new kitchen staff . maybe i ordered the wrong thing . or maybe it s just me . i have no idea . . . but i can safely say i had one of my worst dining experiences , ever , at this restaurant . n nevery review i ve ever read for this place has said that the restaurant is okay , if not pretty good . n nthey must not have had the food i had . the sheppard s pie was the worst i ve ever tasted . no joke , it tasted the way canned cat food smells . it also looked like canned cat food . i just thought since it was an irish themed restaurant , it would have decent sheppard s pie . i was horribly mistaken . n nnot only was the food bad , but it took minutes to get our order in and hour or so for the food to come out . i would understand had it been busy , but seriously , there were maybe other groups of people beside myself and the two others i was with . n neven if someone were to offer to buy me dinner there , i don t think i could ever go back .

0,"visited this restaurant on sunday . . around pm for lunch . i walked into the place and saw a little bit of a difference in lighting from other pf chang s i ve been to . they actually had their curtains open to let in some natural light , which was really nice . you could see the place was clean and it gave the atmosphere a more of a casual vibe . i enjoy eating at places where it s a little more personable with the wait staff , which wasn t the case this afternoon . the wait staff on this afternoon wasn t focused on the customer , which was me . it seemed like a young crowd of wait staff that didn t want to work a sunday afternoon . i didn t see any genuine smiles from them . they had the attitude of blah , blah blah , here s your food , bye . i ordered the peppercorn beef dish , and my husband ordered the kung pow dish extra spicy . for an app we had spring rolls . the app didn t taste fresh , and the sweet and sour sauce served with it was bland . our meals were a decent size but low on sauce for some reason . the rice was a little dry . and my husband s extra spicy kung pow didn t have any pow at all . so at this point i was asking myself , why eat here ? i could have gone to any neighborhood chinese place and have gotten the same quality of food with paying the price . . i m really considering being a little stuck up saying that these chain restaurants are expected to have a certain standard , and why can t they go above it to empress me to come back ? i think in this type of economy i m really going to start to eat at the more mom and pop places where you can feel the heart and soul that is put in the dinning experience . i probably am not going to go back to this chain because of this experience .

0,"this is a terrible mcdonalds ! if you order meals in the drive through , you will have to park and will be lucky if they ever come out with your food , and if you get lucky and they do bring your food out , they always forget half the order . also half of your order will have sat on the counter while they cook your frys . service sucks , and management is worse ! don t expect much if you eat here . . .

0,my dog sydney and i are currently new to the las vegas area . we have been going to puppy love prior to miss vicky retirement . i recently got sydney groomed and had an unpleasant experience . i dropped my yorkshire terrier off in good health and he was returned with swollen red eyes . the groomer advised me to bring him back that shampoo and or hair may have gotten into his eyes . the next day when i brought syd back with the veterinarian bills it was a new story . that they couldn t say that the irritation was from the shampoo and or hair and i had left their facility . sydney has been groomed his whole life with no issues . throughout the whole process puppy love has been very professional . the point is brought in my dog with no problems in came out with a problem . highest grooming bill yet

0,"most starbucks have improved greatly where you can get quick and correct orders . n nthis airport location is right off the alaska airlines flight from seattle gates . so most folks hit it on the landing or exit to get their caffeine fix . n nit is run by only two employees in fairness , it is a small location so don t think more than can fit without being on top of each other . n nthey do their best to move quickly but with just person working while takes orders it can have long lines depending on what time you land .

0,i was very disappointed . a group of us went on a friday night for live music . they are in dire need of an interior decorator . we felt awkward as soon as we walked in the door . there were basically picnic benches for tables and nothing on the walls . the beer was good but the atmosphere is lacking . 
0,"yea you see it , two stars . we arrived around , it wasn t too busy , plenty of seats at the bar and around the lounge . the three of us went up to the bar to grab a drink , and the male bartender , probably pushing , wearing a afflication shirt two sizes too small and attempting to pull off a faux hawk , asks us what we would like . i ask if they have a specialty cocktail menu , he says no , not in a joking manner but kinda rough and rude . i could have sworn i read in reviews they had specialty cocktails , but ok , so then i ask what kind of pinot noir they have , he responds back to me , oh you must be the difficult friend excuse me ? yes i am picky when it comes to wine and specialty cocktails and that s the reason i ask before ordering a drink . i should have walked out then and there but my two friends wanted to stay and check out the lounge area . so after we sat there for a little bit , i didn t even finish my wine i was given o . p . p , others people pinot we decided to leave . after leaving bar bistro and having a wonderful experience over there with the bartender and the cocktails , i wouldn t give this guy another dime .

0,"i usually go to this store every months for hair supplies , i had encounter one of their associates , she s the older lady , i m not sure if she is white but she s light skinned . short hair . she had horrible customer service . i brushed it off . then last night there she is again , i am waiting to be checked out while she is standing there looking at another employee show another customer some merchandise . in my head i m like should i tell her to check me out , i don t want to sound rude . then she looks at me and tells me , do you need help ? i answered yes i am waiting to be checked out then she says that means you haven t been helped therefore the answer would be yes but she said this in a very sarcastic way . omg after that i was so upset , i am a customer not your friend daughter etc . you don t talk like that to customers . then i had a coupon for renewing my membership , i gave her the code , she looked at me and told me that s not it , i gave it to her again and again the same thing . i told her i have it right here that is the number she just acted like she didn t care then another employee comes and shows here what she was doing wrong and she didn t even apologize for acting like i was stupid . honestly i m totally disappointed , they won t be seeing me there anymore .

0,this place was alright to me . not the best ramen but not the worst either . i ve had better but this could work if you need a quick fix on a budget . 
0,"meh . i ve experienced better . n ni tried the bellagio buffet a couple vegas trips back about a year ago and all of my friends thought it was alright , we were more excited about leaving to watch the water show . the next day , we went to rio and regretted even wasting our money at the bellagio buffet . n nsince that time , i ve heard so many good reviews about the place . my boyfriend told me it was on food network for its fine selection of fresh meat ! so two vegas trips ago , i willingly went with my friends to give bellagio buffet another try . n nit was memorial day weekend so prices were more expensive , however i can t remember exactly how much because my boyfriend paid . we came around pm for a late lunch so we could stay until dinner p when i walked in , i thought maybe i was wrong about this place . i was so excited to dig into everything they had because everything looked so good and there were so many selections ! ! n nhowever , for me , it was all looks . i probably grabbed about full plates piled with food and two plates of dessert one for fruit . my favorite was the dessert as always . i didn t finish any of my plates and wouldn t have been able to even if i forced myself to . to get a better picture of the food , the breakfast bacon was my favorite item because it was so crunchy . maybe the pesto mashed potatoes were high on my list . the meat was disappointing , considering it was raved about on food network . the pasta was good but my favorite was rotated out before i could get seconds oh yeah , and the sushi sucked ! ! ! ! ! i couldn t even swallow my first piece . n nfor dessert , i grabbed a bunch of different pastries that looked pretty . i m used to pretty looking dessert that tasted mediocre . however , their fruit tarts were yummy from top to bottom ! the crust had a nice texture , the creme wasn t too sweet or too bland and the strawberries had dark chocolate sprinkles on top ! it was heaven , i tell ya . then i found chocolate dipped strawberries ! ! the thing was they were half milk chocolate and half white chocolate ! and the strawberries were huge ! ! ! ! n nall in all , i m not paying for bellagio buffet again . compared to a buffet from home , it s really good ! the food isn t horrible but i d much rather go to rio !

0,"a good friend took me and my wife to dinner last night . two of us ordered the sweet potato chicken risotto . bland no seasoning and flavor . rice , some string beans , chapped chicken and small squares of sweet potato . awful . i have tasted better food in a . can of stew creating a whopping profit for yuck in a bowl . my friend was buying and i did not want to make a scene with the waiter . i had to soak it in salt and pepper to make it palatable . the waiter was fantastic so i can t blame him for the cook and manager . my wife gave me some of her lasagna and it was bland with no special seasoning or taste . this place is always busy and there must be some good food on the menu . we drank water and had one appetizer . over for with tip no drinks . bad deal . don t let the atmosphere fool you . i should have told the waiter to take it back but in respect for my friend i did not .

0,"this place clearly doesn t want business . i was looking for a tux for a black tie event , and i had some questions , not many . i was asking about prices and a group discount that i d been made aware of , but didn t really get a chance to ask about anything else . n nthe woman on the phone judy was clearly impatient and sounded annoyed by my couple of questions . that s fine . i ll never go to this men s wearhouse location now , for suits or a tux . the people at jerry s were much friendlier and more accommodating on the phone . as for suits , i d rather drive an extra mins to the store at boca park .

0,"have i been eating from the same place as everyone else ? n ni ve eaten in restaurant once , and had a pick up order a few weeks later . so , unfortunately , i don t think this is a fluke . n nmy first time , we had a waitress carissa , or clarissa i believe who was very kind . she catered to our every need . didn t leave us hanging for anything . n ngarlic knots . nmeh . i tasted salt more than anything . . . if you don t eat them kinda quickly , they did seem to get hard fairly easily . . . un appetizing . n nsalad . nour salad came , and it was ok . i don t know if it was the house salad or what . . . . it had fresh mozzarella , and tomatoes with lettuce . . . . we put ranch on it , and it needed pepper in my opinion . . . i know that it s a salad , but jeez . . . . . i ve never tasted anything so plain before . n npizza . nholy shizz . grease city . when you got to fold the slice to eat it , the grease drips . . . . i mean , it s like someone went to get an oil change and instead of using a pan or rags to collect the oil , they used a pizza . nflavorless , too . just , flat . no crunchy or flakey crust . . . almost just tastes like under cooked dough . n nmy family really likes this place , and i don t understand it one bit . n nfamily put in a pick up order , i got to the restaurant before the order was ready . . . . and i waited . picked up the pizza and wings . . . . once again , just meh . in the miles it took me to get to my parent a house , the grease was pooled on top of the pizza . . . wings weren t crispy . n nlet s just say i go home hungry when the pick up from here . i can barely finish a slice .

0,"i m not a vegetarian but i almost always order something vegetarian anyway when i go out to eat . naturally i thought then that going to a vegetarian place would be a good idea . i was disappointed . n nnothing on the menu was very tempting , mainly because it all seems to be classic meat dishes with meat replacements . i would ve loved to see a list of interesting soups and salads . n nthe spinach artichoke dip tasted pretty terrible which i didn t think was possible and the crackers it came with tasted like cardboard . the other dishes went similarly . n ni will say they had really interesting , delicious cocktails !

0,"i have no idea what the other reviewers are smoking , because this food was completely inedible . i am by no means a snob about food . i like everything from in n out to organic free range beef . i just like food that tastes good , the end . n nand when i am hungover and starving , i am incredible easy to please when it comes to food . so , sunday morning in vegas i could have eaten just about anything and have been happy . however , i took one bite of each thing on my plate which was a sampling from each different cuisine area , and couldn t stomach a second bite of anything . it was so incredibly gross , there is no other word for it . i was in a group of five people and we all could not believe how disgusting the food was . we all left hungry from a buffet ! ! n ni really can t understand how anyone could give this buffet a positive review on yelp . i can only hope that i can save someone their by stopping them from eating here . we almost warned the people in line as we were leaving . the only good part about our meal was our server , nina , who was so friendly and sweet and amazing , we didn t have the heart to tell her how bad the food was . plus it s not like she cooked it , anyway . so , this one star is for you , nina !

0,if i could give stars i would but i cant . yelp should change this feature . worst customer service experience ive ever had . needed to catch a flight for a funeral . i show and the line is long which is understandable . after a half hour i go to enter my info and it says that its to late to check bags . okay no problem . the lady says can you go talk to the agent . sure n nwhen i get there people are in line . over the next hour i cant believe what takes place . they are talking to the people ahead of me about world events etc . there is a time and place for that shit and its not at the airport . when i finally get up there they tell me that i will miss my flight . im glad they pointed out he obvious and i say it wouldn t have happened if you didn t take an hour helping the other people . worst service ever i will plan on driving in the future . 
0,review is for the nightclub only n nfor vegas this place is out of place . i almost felt like i was in a bar in san jose and not in vegas . almost as small as the temple on first street a little exaggeration there . one bar and a mini stand right outside the restrooms . if you like rubbing skins and touching people s sweat on the dance floor this is the place for you to do just that . i think my suite back at the hotel was bigger and enjoyable than lavo . 
0,"went to floyd s on a friday night . the restaurant was pretty full but we were seated right away , which was nice on a friday night . the waitress got our drinks quickly and our order shortly afterwards . however , this is when my experience started to go downhill . my girlfriend ordered a cheese pizza . i was going to order the turkey burger but the waitress warned me that it took them the longest to cook . instead , i ordered the cheeseburger , medium . we then waited at least minutes but could not find our waitress anywhere . i knew something had to be wrong . i don t think a cheeseburger and cheese pizza should take this long . i stopped another waitress and was told that our waitress had already gone off shift . the new waitress went to check on our food and came back to tell us they were still cooking it . why would a medium burger and cheese pizza take that long ? we finally got our food about minutes later . all in all , it took over an hour to finally get our food . no apologies were provided other than they submitted our order during a rush . my cheeseburger came out well done , but at this point i was so hungry i didn t want to send it back . there was no attempt at all to apologize for the issues . it is unfortunate the service was so bad because the food was relatively good if they would have cooked it right . i do not think i will ever come back here as there are other restaurants in the area that are much better .

0,"when the original location at th indian school opened back in the s there were few places like it in the valley prior to the bertos explosion of the aughts and it was , in the parlance of the day , the bomb . super nachos , yo ! n nramiro s has since opened and closed several locations and lamentably the quality has suffered since the west side wessside ! heyday . the food here is decent and fairly priced , but nothing that will knock your socks off . a good after hours joint to aid in soaking up the poison you ve consumed all evening .

0,"after midnight this place offers cent wings . you can order a max of per person . bud light per order and you have to have a hooters card which is free . n nso my boyfriend and i came here and order wings , a bud light , and ranch they charge for ranch at around am . our bill was only something . what a steal ! ! ! . . however what you pay for is really what you get and boy oh boy their wings were gross . it was greasy and tasted nothing like buffalo wings . it tasted plain and you can really taste the oil . n neven if my meal was cheap i will probably never go here again . sorry ! n n star for the pricing n star for opening late"
0,"i typically use arizona import specialists in tempe , az . unfortunately i had a gas line bust on one of my dual tanks . it was a saturday so i used my aaa road side assistance year member to have it towed to the car shop . with the great reviews and the aaa recommendations i did not hesitate to have the work completed on my v custom deluxe . they completed the work in a timely fashion . after i pick up the vehicle i filled the tank with gas and it didn t work . i took my truck back and they reviewed their work and the manager informed me that the switch was malfunctioning . i asked if they had tested it after the repair work was complete . they said , no . it is common practice to test something that has been fixed . i spoke with the manager and we had a disagreement about what was wrong with the truck . he refused to fix it and wanted to charge me an additional . to fix something i already paid him to fix . . needless to say i took my truck back to my original mechanic and they solved the problem right away . problem resulting in a kinked hose the one they replace . the arrogance and dishonesty from the manager was nothing short of a disappointment . i understand the dynamics of the repair and was willing to work out our differences but this man insisted the malfunction was not caused by the work he had done . this is a great example of a shop with great technicians mechanics and terrible management . n nyours truly , n chevy truck nnm"

0,"i too , had a similar experience with training at mh fitness . mark initially seemed like a professional and a great person to work out with . this continued for the first month or two , but then i saw a drastic change in the level of professionalism beyond that . i was training times a week and paying closer to a month . although i did learn a ton that i m now able to use on my own , mark s lack of consideration for monitoring injuries and unprofessional behavior ultimately drove me to move on from the gym . after firing mark , he attempted to unlawfully draft from my bank account , which was resolved in my favor in a dispute with my bank . i will not be back and recommend people do their homework before contracting with a trainer . lesson learned , for me anyway .

0,horrible ! ! ! ! it s a friday in vegas and there are customer service people working . we have waited over an hour . will never rent here again . use another car rental agency . don t waste your time . 
0,i went for lunch when they opened and the revolving selections were great . it was a little pricey but delicious . went back after they switched to all u can eat and i think they went in the wrong direction . n ni guess the revolving business model failed so they took a risk and went to the gluttony tactic . they no longer use the revolving at all . the food was ok if you like tiny thin pieces of sushi on top of massive pieces of rice . the rolls were a little better but on the rainbow roll the avocado was the edge of browning . i hope they find a better balance between quality and quantity but they are not there yet . n nbuyer beware . 
0,"sorry i just had to write on yelp to complain about the lv monorail . i am giving poor marks for overall design and efficiency . i am big fan of public transit but if there were to be a case made against public transit , the lv monorail would be that case . the monorail is too far away from the strip and the walk from a station to a hotel s entrance that is not right at the stop is too long . the cost of per person each way is far too expensive . now had the monorail been built over las vegas blvd . connected by overpass to hotels and each side of the strip , started from the airport and gone downtown , it would be the envy of the nation . but a monorail to nowhere is a just a plain waste of money . it is like driving your car and then having to get out a walk the rest of the way . n nthe planners of this system did the community a real disservice .

0,"wow . if it was possible to give a place negative stars , i would have . i purchased a gift certificate for this restaurant on restaurant . com . my husband and i took our three small children there on saturday night . the hostess looked annoyed that she had to seat us . once at the table , three waiters passed us by without asking what we wanted to drink , etc . once we had been there for about minutes , a bus boy brought us some salsa . he asked if we knew about the salsa and i said no , we hadn t eaten there in years . his response was oh it s the same which didn t explain anything at all . we continued to sit for another minutes or so , with no drinks , and thirsty children as waiter after waiter passed us by . the table that got seated seconds before us got their food and we still hadn t been served even a glass of water . at this point , we left . on my way out , i decided i should talk to a manager . the bartender got him for me . as he was coming to the front , he refused to make eye contact with me , and actually passed me right by and was chatting with the hostess at the station . when i said excuse me ! he turned and said yeah . i explained to him what happened and that we were leaving and his response was to turn to me , gesture to the restaurant and say the restaurant is full , you think you make a difference ? i have never been so insulted in my life . i would never return to this restaurant , and i would never ever recommend it to anyone . what a disaster . the customer sevice sucks , the manager is an ass , and the entire experience was a total joke .

0,we went in to this location last week . we left . the air conditioner filters in the ceiling above the staff were nasty . then we looked in the freezer and the coils were just as gross . a cleaning might be a good idea . 
0,the service is awful but besides that the owner has a very smart mouth on him and is very rude . if you show any concern he seems to want to punish you and say your order wi take hour and make u wait . he is very inconsiderate and literally a smart mouth . he charges extra on the bill so make sure you check your biil . food is nothing to brag about . and with his attitude not worth it all . 
0,"the buffet lines were too long , so i ended up here with friends all looking to get rowdy . despite the scores of to year olds , we had a good time . at the end of our meal , i sent a chocolate volcano dessert to the neighboring table of kids with matching soccer shirts on . it looked really good and probably should have ordered it for us too . when it came out and the servers sang happy birthday would have been a total coincidence if it was one of their birthdays ! , the kids went from being completely confused to being stoked to dig in the chocolate tower . n ni had the bacon burger , which was recommended by our server . she asked how i wanted it cooked . i requested medium rare , but it was a little more cooked than medium . it wasn t impressive , especially for being the best item on the menu . n ni drank two very weak fruit punches . not impressed here either , since they were so weak . n neven as a grown mostly adult , i was taken by the atmosphere . the tropical rain forest motif and salt water aquariums were pretty awesome .

0,"so it s saturday night . the girlfriend and i are watching our colleges play some top notch basketball while having a few adult beverages . after one school wins , mine u of a , we decide it s time for dinner . well what goes better with basketball and beers than pizza ? we were proven very wrong . . . . . . n n nso we ordered crust because her sister had a great pizza a week earlier and it was close . we decided the classic hawaiian pizza would hit the spot for us tonight . we called in and they said it would take around minutes which was perfect . n nwe arrived just in time and bought our pizza as it was coming out of the oven . we got home and opened up the anticipated box too see our classical favorite . . . . needless to saw we were shocked . n ncrust s take on a hawaiian pizza is the biggest miss i have ever seen in a classic pizza . don t get me wrong i appreciate a new twist on an old classic but this was sheer laziness . first off it s a square not round pizza this in my mind was a plus due to the thickness and crispiness . however that was the only plus to the whole pizza . n nfor those of you that went to public elementary school do you remember pizza day ? its was a square greasy piece of pizza with cubed pepperoni . well the hawaiian pizza at crust isn t far off . n nthe pizza came out with large slices and a medium thick crust . the cheese and meat looked like deli slices you would pick up at safeway laid on top not even covering the pizza . the final touch was canned cubed pineapple on top of the deli meat and cheese . n nif you are looking for a pizza your toddler can make but want to call it a scottsdale fusion then i suggest you run to crust . if not then i would suggest papa johns . . . . they deliver . . . .

0,"i ll keep this short and straight to the point . i m so dissapointed . i came in with a group of friends during the weekend . i asked for a basic mani pedi . payed . the lady i had wasn t the most pleasent . while finishing my to n coat she accidentally bumped a nail and instead of taking the polish off that finger and redoing it , she just put another topcoat over trying to cover it up . it was a glob of clear uneven nail polish on one finger . . . clearly this isn t going to end well . i sat and let them all dry for over thirty min . as soon as i got in my car that nail was ruined , so i went back inside and had them fix it while they talked about me in korean . n nall in all it was not worth it . my mani even after they fixed the bad nail only lasted one full day . my pedicure didn t even last a week . for a pedicure not to last at least a week is absurd in my opinion . n ni won t be back .

0,"my hubs and i went here for a saturday lunch we kind of randomly picked a place and it was fine . . . it seemed like it was a manager who seated us and he had no clue where to put us , so we said a booth was fine , and he put us in a booth that was seriously meant to seat about . our waitress got drinks quickly but that was the only thing that happened timely . i had tomato bisque with grilled cheese so good and my husband had their mac n cheese burger . we waited about minutes for drink refills and another minutes for the check and had to flag her down for that . i think she had one other table . . . it s probably a great bar at night , but i would not recommend anyone come here for lunch or anything . i m not sure why they re even open during the day . . . ?

0,"i came here for happy hour , but the vibe was actually pretty somber . the bartender was forgetful and seemed like she could care less about serving drinks . the first wine i ordered on the menu wasn t even in stock . it was an odd experience all around . n nthe one redeeming quality was the food we had a hummus and veggie plate that was actually pretty good . perhaps someone in the kitchen still has a clue ? the rest of the evening we basically just drank our wine and tried to limit our interaction with the staff . n ndear walnut i used to love the shadyside location , so please try to shoot for that level of quality when selecting your bartenders and building your menu .

0,"worst service i ve ever received . they simply care more about themselves than pleasing the customer . nwe came to meet my mom and surprise her , we asked to have one of the several empty tables near my mom s table pulled next to her table and my mom s server refused , because it wasn t her section . uh ok , whatever ! so my husband and i just sit at a table next to my mom and wait and wait and wait for our server who never comes . ni say to my husband , i think we need to let the hostess know since we just sat here . so i did and apologized for not making her aware of us taking the table and could she get our server . nthe hostess was more than put out but i ignored it . our server grudgingly showed up , took our order and disappeared , never to be heard from again until our food showed . i had two eggs over medium , they were fine except my food was served on a warped plastic plate that kept spinning every time i ate off of it . nmy husband ordered basic eggs benedict . the eggs were so under cooked that the whites looked literally like snot . so nasty . he pointed it out to the server and she proceeded to tell him that s how eggs benedict are served and continued to argue with him even after he told her that was not true . nthe manager who came over was quite nice and apologetic and removed the eb from our bill with out hassle . nit took forever to get our bill from the disgruntled server and when we finally did , it appeared that the eb had not been removed . i asked the previously rude hostess who is now our cashier to look into it and she proceeds to tell me that the reason we had such a bad experience was because we had sat ourselves . nwell needless to say at this point , i m offended beyond reason and i begin to lose it with the hostess . the manager comes again and is very nice again , but he clearly has no control over his staff . ni nor my husband will ever frequent this establishment again ! the food is not worth the hassle and it s very over priced . i ended up paying for two eggs , toast , hash browns , bacon , and coffee . and as someone else that wrote a review stated the entire wait staff starting with the hostess are rude , unfriendly and act like they are doing you a favor . stay away . i had been going there since the place opened and kept having bad experiences , which culminated into my last and final atrocious experience .

0,"i usually love coming here . the coffee is unique and the atmosphere is very chill and relaxing . however , today i came in and the girl behind the counter was the rudest person i ve come across in a while . at first she was annoyed that i made her get up from doing nothing behind the counter . then i ask what her favorite beverage was something i usually ask and cafes and restaurants , thinking they would know the best thing and she said she didn t like any of it . literally said that . she then asked what my boyfriend wanted and then rolled her eyes when i said we were splitting a drink . maybe she was having a bad day but that was unacceptable .

0,"last week i went in at around am and bought a breakfast roll which has elements of breakfast in it . . . ham , egg , cheese , but bakedn in a whole wheat roll . it was stale and hard and . . . although i tried . . . ultimatedly inedible . i was very sad . i like the idea of great harvest bread company but in actual life it s stale . . . i had a deja vu of why i hadn t been back in over a year . . . i had bought a morning muffin or breakfast roll a year ago . . it was stale . and didn t go back until time passed and i forgot about the bad experience . now i have things to remind me not to go back in the future . i emailed the company and told of the staleness and . . . no reply . so that s why i m writing this review . n nupdate i received this reply from the owner a week later . . . so i will up my rating to stars . . . n ngood afternoon , n nthank you for taking the time to send us an e mail about a less than satisfactory product you purchased in our bakery last thursday . first i have to appolgize for taking so long to get back to you . as you may know this little shop is owned by our family , and with that we are always busy doing many things . from farmer s markets on both thursdays and saturdays , to baking loaves of bread saturday with a church youth group for their moms on sunday , visiting with folks at a local retirement home yesterday and a seminar i had commited to today . wow , it s been a busy week , and that only covers the past days . i finally had a chance to check my e mails . the business e mails go to my husband and he forwarded yours onto my personal e mail so that i may answer you . n nanyways , i appreciate your patience . we do bake all of our breakfast rolls every morning . the one that you purchased wouldn t have been old , but it would have had to have been overbaked to be inedible . i really sincerely apologize for that . we do make everything here in the bakery from scratch and with that sometimes leaves room for human error . n nso to thank you for taking the time to send us an e mail , i would like to make things right and offer you your choice a sandwich or any loaf of bread . n nmy compliments of course . i am typically here in the bakery mon wed all day . thursday only til then off to a farmers market . all day friday . and another farmers market on saturday . we are closed on sundays for family time . i will be putting your name on our message board with instructions for a free sammie or loaf of bread . n nwarmly , nleslie walston , owner ngreat harvest bread co . n n n update i did go back and unfortunately ordered a savannah bar and iced coffee . the savannah bar was okay but small . the iced coffee i had a sinking feeling as i saw the person pull dig the cut in a bucket of ice and proceed to pour hot coffee over it . this is going to water down by an already weak coffee . i asked if she could give me a little less ice , she obliged but that just resulted in a dishwater , luke warm watery coffee that was undrinkable . so i was foiled again . i sent an email to the owner again suggesting they serve full strenght coffee that s been kept in a refrigerator then poured over ice . . . no reply back . n nso i m sorry to say i ve downgraded my rating to starts . and i m sorry to say i will likley not go back . too disappointing even though i want it to be better .

0,ordered take out with my coworkers and wanted just the sandwich not the meal . i get there and they put a meal for mine even though i didnt want the meal . the girl told me since the order was already put through they couldnt change it . its just fries ! how hard is it to change in their system to remove the fries from my order that ended up costing me an addition . . i had to pay for something i didnt want . not to mention the girl behind the counter was rude about it . food is decent but i will not go there again due to how they treat their customers . if a customer specially does not want something they shouldnt be forced to pay for it due to them not know how to change an order ! ! not to mention my fries are barely warm and my gyro is mostly lettuce .

0,"the service was good . it was clean . and it was very , very , very full of a ton of really old people . i haven t seen this many old people in the same place at once since my last trek to sun city . n nbut i didn t hold the old people factor against one eyed dog . i like old people . i had a minor in gerontology in undergrad . it was just a little peculiar . on a friday night , i felt a little like i was sitting in a nursing home cafeteria . n nthen i noticed that this place was supposed to be a british pub . and their decorations seemed a bit , um , tgibritain . but i m no expert on what is an authentic british look , so i didn t hold that against them either . n nbut the food was unimpressive . i wasn t really hungry , and i joined my guests late , so i just sampled what my husband ordered . the wings were peculiar . i wasn t there when he ordered , but i m sure that he asked for the wings to be crispy . this is the first time that i ever had wings that were too crispy . they were dessicated . and the sauce was adequately hot , but too vinegary , and with a peculiarly flavored vinegar . maybe they used malted vinegar ? i ve never tasted an octogenarian , but i imagine this is what they might taste like . n nthe few fries i tasted were like frozen french fries that i could easily make at home . our friend ordered the fish fry sandwich , walleye , which he seemed pleased with . the waitress told us that the fish fry dinner was even better with the sides . i ll take her word for it , she was very nice and efficient . n nit s near our friend s place , so if he suggested it again , i wouldn t say no and i would definitely stick with the fish fry dinner . but i won t be rushing back .

0,"um , this airport sucks , okay ? avoid at all costs . ni flew through here two times last week . both coming and going we experienced hour long runway delays . seriously . when landing , we had to chill out someplace random b c another plane was at our gate unexpectedly . and then there was no skybridge . and then we had to circle around a few times because the airport gods grew tired of us sitting and waiting . then , both times we took off heading to and from tally , we had to wait , stacked up on the runway , for minutes . case in point , the pilot actually told us excitedly once we were ninth for departure . unless clt is your home , fly through atl .

0,"as a connoisseur of indian cuisine , we know good indian food and this was definitely not . save your money and go to taj mahal or tamarind instead . n ndishes were overpriced . kabobs and chicken tikka were small and tasteless . chicken fried rice tasted like a bad biryani . butter chicken was average , but nothing special . you really can t screw up naan either . the only good thing was the rasmalai and it was probably made with a packet of gits from the indian grocery . they may have some better options , but we were extremely disappointed with everything we tried . n nhopefully the food quality , portions , and prices will improve otherwise , this isn t the only indian restaurant in town thankfully .

0,"so my kids and i were having a lovely day shopping at miracle mile when they decided they wanted something from sugar factory . we sat down at the tables outside the bar but before i could send them inside with money to spend or buy a drink for myself , a bartender came out and rudely told us if we weren t buying anything at the bar we would have to leave ! the tables are for paying customers only . i told him i was planning on buying both a drink for me and candy for them however now that we were talked to like that we would be leaving ! i will spend my money elsewhere with good customer service instead ! will never come back to this location !

0,"the hash browns were semi cold . . . nmy chicken noodle soup was better though . plenty of noodles , carrots and celery . other than that , nothing really special here . "
0,"so i went to bonjour vietnam with three girlfriends the past friday night . it was a beautiful evening so we sat on the patio . service was good the drinks were fabulous . . . my poulet was great . and then the night got weird . n na man walked up to our table and for several minutes was mumbling at us . we calmly asked him to leave . he did not . he started cussing , graphically explaining what he would do to us and threatened us . then he started spitting at our table . n nstaff did nothing to stop this event . they did not come out they did not shuffle him along until after i had called the police and eventually a cook came out . n nour bill came , nothing was comped . no visit from the manager . we were literally threatened , all staff saw it occurring and nothing happened . this is not acceptable treatment . if you own a business downtown you have to be prepared to shuffle the occasional individual like this away from paying patrons . seamus s has a security guard that immoderately moves people along . extremely disappointed and between making a police report and identifying the suspect , our dinner was ruined . .

0,usually go to other hour pho spot on spring mountain down the road pho little saigon late night but the people i was with pushed me into trying this place out . n nthe place looks nice but first impression of having to wait minutes to be seated with a bunch of open tables cause the host was to busy flirting with the girls . then it took another ten minutes for someone to even come by and take our order . the food showed up pretty quick but easily sub par . rude stand offish attitudes from all the workers and manager . people seem to just love this place cause they server large portions of poor soup all night long . im going to stick with my regular spot down the road . 
0,"i have been on the search for a good nail salon for some time now and this is not the place . i get gel manicures every two weeks like clock work and every two weeks i am going somewhere new . i don t like when they use acetone to soak off the old gel polish , it it extremely bad for your nails , and i m not even sure what the half cut lime rubbed on my nails was for . also i asked her to just cut them a tiny bit and she cut them almost all the way down . not going back and the search continues . . . . . . . . . . n "
0,"like cassandra h , my husband and i were also on our way to a different restaurant and discovered that this place was open . we checked out the menu in the basket by the entrance and were immediately greeted by the waiter before we even opened the door . n nwe ordered lunch specials of chicken teriayki . i had tempura veggies and my husband had tempura shrimp with his . we both had the miso soup . my husband also ordered a spicy california roll he s not a big sushi eater . n nthe california roll was pretty large but it had no flavor at all . n nour lunch portions were large but the chicken breast was not quality at all . it was spongy and did not taste that great . the soup was ok and the rice that came on the side was kind of mushy . n nsome of their menu prices seemed high . n noverall the food was ok . i also did not enjoy being sick to my stomach a couple hours after eating here . n nmy husband and i will continue to travel to lake mead and tenaya area to eat at yummy sushi on nights when we feel like eating sushi . this was a huge disappointment as i had high hopes for this place since it is so close to our house .

0,"for someone who is completing their masters degree and studying for certified public accounting exams , this library is one of the few places i have found that offers a silent space to focus . n nhowever my experience is negative as i dread walking in those doors everyday because of the tall security guard who works morning shifts and treats me like i m years old and watches me like a hawk loves to tells me what i m doing wrong when all i am looking for is a place to study . i feel extremely uncomfortable here and slightly harassed . the other shorter and slightly larger security guard seems to have no problem with me and i do not behave any differently when the different guards are around nor do i disrupt anyone so stop watching me ! n nit s a shame to see this is where my tax dollars are going . i hope this improves soon .

0," i will read yelp reviews before every dining experience , i will read . . . . nmade a last minute decision to stop in for a drink and a bite before a show at the arizona broadway theatre next door . bad call . place was dirty had to ask for a table wipe after we sat down . ordered table side guac which arrived already made up . okay . salsa was grainy and more interesting and flavorful than most runny tomato salsas , so saved the zero star rating . tortilla chips were stale . margaritas were meh mine was frozen wife s on the rocks have had many better . we split a chile rellanos dinner not being a mexican fan i thought it was tasteless , but my wife liked it . learned my lesson don t ever even think about eating without studying yelp first !

0,"poor quality , too expensive , dirty . n ni give up on this place for their all you can eat salad and pizza buffet which costs way too much about . consistently poor quality pizza , stained carpet , unmotivated staff . i ve eaten here for lunch for almost three years now , and every time i go back i keep asking myself why do i bother coming back to this place ? today , tables were unclean , and the salad bar had cottage cheese that tasted spoiled and the pizza was really poor quality . i know how hard it is to run a pizza establishment , and i feel for anyone who tries , really i do , but if you have time to lean , you have time to clean . somebody needs to learn how to pick up a rag instead of texting on their cell phone . n nhint take down the tip jar . we all know you expect a tip for nothing . it shows .

0,"i wish i would ve checked yelp before calling kelly s glass . they don t keep appointments at all . this is with two chances . first they failed to show up , call or reschedule . their manager said it was a mixup to keep the other guys honest in price let them do the estimate . i agreed to it only to have them show up early pounding on the door . waking my yr old grandfather and wanted access inside where he was sleeping . if they would ve kept the appointment which we set neither of these would ve been a problem . no matter how good the deal i will not be calling them again would suggest you save yourself the trouble as well"
0,"i don t usually write reviews on yelp , but after last night s dinner at nine fine irishmen , i had to come on and share . my dad and i have been coming to nine fine irishmen for around or years . the first time we ever visited , we were amazed at how much food we got . my dad had the fish and chips and i had the shepherd s pie . every year that we ve come back , we ve gotten the same things and have always been pleased . the service has always been hit or miss , but the food kept us coming back . sadly , last night s trip was a major disappointment and we are probably not going to ever return . n nas per usual , my dad ordered the fish and chips and i ordered the shepherd s pie . the meal came out decently fast and our waitress took acceptable care of us . when the food arrived however , we were not pleased . what had once been a massive helping of fried fish and french fries had become two small strips of fish and a handful of floppy fries . my shepherd s pie looked the same , but the beef was no longer anything special , but tasted instead like a hamburger that had been broken up and drenched in mashed potatoes . the generous pieces of carrot that had been mixed with the beef on our previous visits had been reduced to small and i mean minuscule pieces of what i think may have been carrots , they were honestly too small to even be sure . n nafter we picked at our food for a half hour , my dad decided to ask the waitress what had happened to the fish and chips and she explained that they had gotten a new chef and that he had traded out regular cod for alaskan cod . for , i would say that the alaskan vs . whatever cod they were using before is definitely not worth the price . don t waste your time here , go to ri ra in the mandalay bay instead . we are so sad that our favorite irish pub is no longer living up to what it was before . n nhonestly , don t listen to the positive reviews . if you want to spend over a person on subpar food then visit , but if you are looking for big , delicious portions then don t waste your time . "
0,"i really do love the food here but the rest of the experience just makes me never want to go back . n ni ve been several times where i ve had to wait much much too long for my food . even at lunch in the middle of the week when the restaurant was only half full . but last night took the cake . n nwe came in and since there were no free tables , we sat at the bar . we ordered some sodas and then our food pretty quickly . i had to be at work an hour and a half later so we definitely thought there d be plenty of time but after minutes without getting our food , i was getting very anxious . i finally asked a waitress to check on our food and i told her i had to leave soon to go to work . she kind of dilly dallied into the kitchen and came back out and told us that our waitress would let us know what was going on . n nour waitress came back out , did some stuff on the computer , cleaned some plates , and all while i was just staring at her waiting for an answer . finally she comes to me and says that the kitchen lost a few tickets or i guess they thought our food had already come out or some lame answer . i told her to forget it because i just couldn t wait any longer . she said well don t worry about the drinks . thanks . . . if i had known i was going to get free drinks instead of dinner , i would ve ordered a bottle of wine . i would ve really appreciated a gift certificate or something . n nnow , i have worked in many restaurants and i understand things happen . but she really should ve noticed after minutes that we have not had our food and checked on it herself . the fact that i had to ask and then there was no sense of urgency or sincere remorse really irked me . i ended up going down to fuel for a quick slice of pizza and inhaled it before work . not what i had looked forward to doing right before hours on my feet serving people drinks . n ni think i ll just be officially done with this place . unfortunately .

0,"after watching the subway episode of undercover boss , i kind of expected a different experience . took my kiddos there for a later than normal dinner almost pm . we were the only ones in the place and had to wait for the employee to finish eating before ordering . not only did they yes , there were employees not greet us , but they chatted amongst themselves with their backs to us . when they finally got around to us , i asked for a tuna on flatbread . they were out of flatbread . since i don t like their bread to begin with , i went without . n nmy kiddos ordered a meatball and a blt . not hard orders to make and thankfully they were correct . two combo meals sub with a drink chips and our bill was just a tad over . n nwhile this is definitely not my favorite subway , the plus side is they re next door to starbucks which does have a drive thru .

0,"i will say this , my cohorts loved this place , i however though meh , i m not a hug fan of pork and it seems that s the only option , i would much prefer chicken , and there was no option for chicken . i personally am no fan of seafood and every dish has a fishy smell or taste , most likely due to the seaweed they put it in . i would come here again with my friends because they love it but i would leave hungry . the service was excellent . "
0,we tried this place only because it had a coupon and what a mistake . spring rolls were so greasy the wrapper was soaked within the mins it took to drive home . then blotting with paper towel soaked up another full towel full of grease . dipping sauce was gelatinous . orange chicken was tough and breading soggy . took loads of antacid to get over this meal . on the plus side the counter girl was sweet when she rejected the coupon because small print said dine in only and only within certain time frames . really ! not the best way to garner new business for your grand opening celebration . coupon flier said grand opening celebration but it appeared to be the same storefront operation that has always been there next to domino s . teriyaki beef was nicely flavored but consistency a little slimy
0,"the pizza is okay but unfortunately it does not make up for the wait time and fiasco of an ordering process . we were second in line to order , however it took longer than acceptable to be asked our slice selections then several minutes to actually receive our meal . the price point is disappointingly higher than the quality of product with limited lunch specials . n nz pizza is two blocks west with lunch specials running about a buck fifty less so i ll be sticking with them from here on out . "
0,"tough place to review since i went with people and the results were wildly different amongst us . we went for lunch and that brings me to main positive comment which is their special giant slices with cheese or pep with a drink for . . i did wait a little long for mine , but when i got it i would say it was decent . when very hot it was pretty good although greasier than many . after cooling off it wasn t really worth eating . some of the party liked it , but overall nothing special and i have to rate it low mostly for the service . i ve never been to a pizza place that took this long to serve pizza . also , one person who came a bit later and ordered a little after us waited minutes for her sandwich and when we were ready to leave she was told that it would be more minutes . so , she got her money back and had someone else s leftover pizza .

0,"this review is for this location only . n nextremely disappointed . i went to get drive thru the other day i ordered drinks harsh brown , burrito and sandwiches . the server confirmed the order and i corrected her when there was a mistake . i drove by the window and gave her my card . not to mention her attitude . she handed me the a plain black coffee ! i asked for a hazelnut coffee with creme and sugar then i went home and took a look . orders of harsh brown were missing . i like dunkin donut but i will never go back to this location again !

0,"i had great experiences at the cosmopolitan hotel in the past but this time it left me thinking if i should ever return . n nday check in nthere were not many people in line but the front desk person seems to be in a rush . did not care to explain where i should go to get to my room , did not offer me a hotel map and his tone of voice was somewhat agitated . what if it was my first time at the hotel , that is just bad experience from the start . not good ! n nday working in the room ni had adjoining room with another co worker . we were working and had multiple conference calls . no disturb sign was on my door but not my co worker s . housekeeping came by multiple times to my co worker s room and i had to tell her come back later . each time she insist to clean my room too . but i didn t need it and i told her so . the room was pretty neat and tidy , plus i just did not want my room cleaned . she was pushy and kept insisting on cleaning at least the bathroom . drove me a little crazy . n nday beeping noise in the room nit started after i opened the mini bar . there was a beeping sound that sounded like the smoke detector battery is low . call the front desk told them about it and they say they will send someone . after an hr no one showed up and i had to leave the room to attend a meeting and dinner . when i got into the room at midnight , i heard the beeping sound again this time more frequent intervals . called the front desk , told them what happened and the person said i never heard about such feedback before not sure what it is . but if it beeps again call us again . the beeps came every so often and by the time i dial for front desk the beeping sound goes away . so the entire night i got woken up by the beeping sound . n nwhen i checked out this morning i wonder to myself if i book my stay in november at cosmopolitan"
0,"they have been in buisness long enough now to get it right and still they fail . the food is still pretty blah and doesn t come out they way it is described on the menu . twice now they have rung up the wrong price for things i ve ordered and the service is basic but nothing great . still , eat here if your starving and don t want to eat at the buffet but if you have better options , i d recommend choosing elsewhere .

0,"me , my fiance and our new puppy decided to drive her camry down to tuscon for the day to see some family . about half way through she notices a grinding sound under the hood , and we pull into a gas station . i notice that she did not have her oil cap on , at all , and oil went all over the hood and other parts of the car and had burned certain parts . she had her oil changed two months prior at napa on th street , and no one had looked under the hood until we were stranded in the middle of the desert . we hope they will help pay for a new motor , but will not give them any more business as something so simple as remembering to screw on the oil cap could have been a much more serious situation . save your money and go somewhere , anywhere else .

0,"this place had been bookmarked for awhile . my husband and i ordered beers and had a question about a couple others . waitress was nice and gave a sample of beer in question , which ultimately ended up with another beer purchase . where the dinner started falling apart is in the kitchen . i ordered a stuffed burger medium well . the burger was raw , and the waitress even commented about how raw the burger was and would send it back . apparently this happened several times this night as she said she had to send several burgers back . when my burger finally comes back out after another minutes , it didn t come with any aioli . additionally they gave me regular fries on the rd attempt instead of sweet potato fries . i didn t have time to try and get it right as we spent . hours getting food and already had plans and needed to quickly go . i had to leave after only eating a small portion of my food as i was running late for our next obligation . sadly , a place i was really looking forward to trying ending up being a place i will never go back to .

0,"not a very authentic irish pub , but then again i have never ever been to ireland , so what do i know about real irish pubs ? what i can do is compare mcfadden s to other pubs that i have been to , and all i can say is , meh . i would not even call this place a pub at all . heck , they don t even refer to themselves as a pub . the restaurants actual name is mcfadden s restaurant and saloon . isn t saloon an old west term ? n nmy girfriend and i visted this place on a thurs . night . they had the whole dueling piano thing going on that night and later on they had what they called a white trash bash . went to the girl they crowned miss white trash . we were not interested and left after we finished our meal . speaking of meals . their menu included things like pizza , pasta primavera , shepard s pie , egg plant parmesan , st . louis bbq ribs , burgers and a reuben sandwich . i had the reuben , which was good , but flat like a panini sandwich . it came with shoe string fries that were obviously straight from the freezer . my girlfriend had the pasta primevera . pasta primevera in what suppose to be a irish restaurant ? she did enjoy it though . the penne pasta was tossed with garden vegetables , a heavy amount of marinara sauce and garlic bread on the side . n n i m gonna have to give this place stars because , meh , i ve experienced better . we were looking for irish and what we got was a complete poser pub that served italian . italian ?

0,"well , now i know why coffee snobs like me have nicknamed them charbucks . horribly overroasted beans make the coffee taste awful and burnt . n nso , why two stars ? well , for the service ! it s awesome . . . seriously . the employees here are great , even if they have to deal with making coffee from super crappy , stale beans . n nif i m in a pinch and have to choose between these guys and the horrendous espresso royale across the street ? i m going with starbucks every time . nice employees will always make me spend my money over an annoying hipster who can t brew a cup of joe worth a damn .

0,"pretty boring inside and out , looks like a doctors office . the food is ok but every time i go it takes forever to come out . the wings are very small but good . go here if you re into paying regular price for very small wings that look like they came from a bat or a bird not a chicken . "
0,"was there last saturday afternoon . not many people in the bar . music was way too loud or am i just getting old ? . disappointed that the only healthy option on the menu an appetizer of chopped veggies and low fat ranch weren t really served with low fat ranch . and the steamed veggies with my meal were loaded with butter , although the prep notes only mention steamed to make me think it s a good for you choice .

0,"we attempted to go to a screening at this theater last night . it was an absolute mess . when we arrived , minutes before the show time , we were placed into a line outside the theater that had about people ahead of us . we were told this was the overflow line , that we would get in only if some of the people with tickets did not show up . we were told that other people with screening passes had exchanged their passes earlier in the day for actual tickets , and only if some of those people did not show up would we get in . later we were told that everyone with tickets was already inside . about p . m . minutes before show time were we told it would be another minutes before we would know if any of us were getting in the line outside was capped at , but were in the line . a manager came out and said there are people who come to the free screenings every week and who know how the system works at different theaters and so they know how to get in . finally , at p . m . , a manager came out and said there was not a single seat open . i asked the girl running the line , if every seat was taken , and all the people with tickets have been inside since you said , how did you not know half an hour ago that there were no open seats ? and she says , we were still waiting for people to show up . nothing they said made any sense , and everything they said was contradictory to something else they said . there was no reason for us to stand out there in line for minutes . they should have just told us when we arrived that it was already full , if it was in fact full . who knows what actually happened . but i will never go there for anything ever again .

0,"tried it twice today , as i didn t feel like going out . lunch was a pastrami sandwich . tasty and reasonably priced . service was good , but the place was empty . n nwent back for dinner . ordered at the bar , because that s what i do . duck confit quesadilla and a house salad . food was surprisingly good for a hotel restaurant . service degraded quickly . watched one of the bar servers sneeze into his hand with no wash to follow . got ignored after receiving food . us mexico soccer and clippers suns seemed to have full attention of the staff . if i rated on food only , they would have gotten stars .

0,"so , i was feeling a little meh today , and decided some thai soup would magically make me better . n ni m still regurgitating the soup as i write . it was like a great sea monster came in my mouth . salty , fishy though not much fish was actually in the broth and just an overall sense of death and despair . i liked the bunsen burner in the middle of the bowl . it flickered and sent little sparks in the air . it was tottie s way of evoking hell , and it was pretty ingenious . n ni d describe the color of the soup as menstrual . a muddy brown red that complimented the over cooked flakes of fish . the fish , like so many of us , had just given up . there was no point in being irresistible anymore , swimming in a hot sea of salty discharge . n ni waited so long just to flag down the waiter so i could get a glass of water to wash the taste of regret out of mouth . as the minutes rolled by , i thought about things the brevity of life , how hour and minutes have gone by that i ll never back , if the guy across from me was flirting with me . . . maybe not . ok , let s just say he was . n na waitress came at last with a glass of water , which i chugged . she asked if i wanted to take the soup home , but i decided to leave it and have it donated to people who are feeling bad about themselves . i might come back on ash wednesday , or when i need to punish myself , or experience my own personal apocalypse in the comfort of an asian restaurant .

0,"valentine s day and what can be better than a wonderful night out with my beautiful wife ! we booked reservations at fogo de chao and were looking forward to a wonderful evening . we arrive promptly for our reservation and were warmly greeted by a minute wait standing in an overcrowded lobby . we overheard the hostess tell another patron that fogo was running behind because people were taking longer than expected to eat . i guess they did not account for folks actually wanting to enjoy their meal and their conversation on valentine s day . n nwe were taken to our table and our waiters greeted us with man , i am tired , can t wait until by shift ends . sorry for the inconvenience . we will try not to ask too much of you . well , i think he read my thoughts because we went to the salad bar and returned to find that we still did not have our drinks , including water , or forks . we did a quick check to see in anyone else was eating with their hands as part of the cultural experience . but , they had forks and water , so we waited . and waited . . . finally , we flagged down a meat chef who kindly gave use the equipment necessary to begin our meal . n nthe food was average . the steaks were great , but the lamb was gamey and the chicken was average and a bit dry . the rolls were beautifully prepared and had an interesting texture . n nwe were invited to try their dessert , but decided that we did not want to overstay our welcome . so we politely asked for our check and waited . . . . we did pass the time watching the waiters flip through the bills from other customers evaluating their tips like the irs agents checking tax returns . n nto be serious for a moment , for the price of this restaurant , we expected a more classic dining experience with a professional , attentive wait staff , etc . however , it may have just been a over overcrowded since it was valentine s day . yet , that is exactly why we picked this establishment in the first place . . . . "
0,"first off , i have to say this with a fair warning . . . this is based on an experience i had with their food truck at the rural hill food truck rally . i have not been to their physical location , but after sampling the food from their truck , i don t think i want to make the effort to go there . you can argue that the product is different because it s served from a truck rather than their restaurant , but that s no excuse for the cruddy product i received from them . n ni waited on line for about twenty minutes at their food truck before getting to order . i wanted to try a variety of stuff so i got a pulled pork slider and a turkey wrap . the pork was extremely disappointing , though the quantity of the food was worth the price . the slider was a tiny bun filled with pulled pork and a pickle . . . no slaw , which was sad . yeah i know it s a small slider but they could have put a tiny scoop of slaw on it ! the meat itself had no smokeyness to it at all , and the meat was tough and dry . definitely not what i expect from bbq down here in north carolina . n nthe turkey wrap was a huge disgrace . now i didn t bother asking what was in it , so i can only blame myself for having to eat what was given to me . their turkey wrap was not smoked turkey , which is what i would assume from a bbq joint . this thing was a wrap filled with turkey salad . . . a very mayo y turkey salad . the mayo overpowered this wrap and made the overall product very runny . i definitely didn t taste any turkey , as the heavy mayo stood out most of all . n nbased on some dry and flavorless pulled pork and an over mayo d turkey salad wrap , i have no intention of going out of my way to visit queen city q s brick and mortar location . you can blame it on it being a food truck , and that they were out of their element , but if that s the case they shouldn t be selling their wares from a truck if that causes it to be substandard . maybe in the distant future , if the situation arose , i would be willing to give them a second chance , but that is a big maybe .

0,"this has been the worst experience ever ! the hotel was dirty with a roach crawling across our room . mold in the bath room . to add insult to injury , they have charged us for nights even though we only stayed . they acknowledge we were there for and that we paid for but the reservation was through priceline and the dates were wrong so they were billing us an extra day totally frustrating ! don t bother . the lack of customer service is appalling ! this experience has been the worst hotel stay i ve ever had .

0,"boo gamestop for gouging your customers . i was calling around to find ps rockband because it s not made anymore i assumed i would find it at a decent price previously used . well gamestop , because they don t make it anymore you decide to sell it for . really ? oh and your comment on why it s so pricey is because they done make it anymore . bad idea . hey i called zia and it s only because they are not assholes and don t take advantage of people . never will i shop here again !

0,"ok , let me be clear . i loved fleur de lis in the mandalay bay ! i loved it so much i made trips to vegas just to eat there and swim in the wave pool . nthat was years ago , so when i got the chance to go again i jumped at it . nunfortunately it is now fleur and is pretty much a different restaurant . the ambience was gone thanks to the wall that was removed and the thumping s music from nthe bar across the casino floor . the food was mabe a or out of where as before it was a solid . nso this time instead of the wonderfull free bread service i had to ask times for bread and when it came it was dry stale and not even tasty , and i had to pay for it . they had the nerve to charge for crappy bread rolls . none of my friends dishes was cold in the middle and all the food was over all under seasoned . nthe only thing that was the same was the price . i will happily pat to dollars per person for good food but spending for food that was worth maybe worth was very hard to take . nso needless to say i won t be going back . n non the plus side rm in the same hotel was awesome .

0,"the store was dirty , one thing i was looking for that they didn t have any of was customer service . all automated checkouts . poor selection of national brands . shopping carts needed a good cleaning . "
0,"based on the rave reviews , i caught alchemy on the wrong day . the atmosphere was pleasant , but loud . i wasn t that hungry , and didn t feel like paying for a sandwich . so i ordered the tomato basil soup , which was the special of the day and sounded delicious . the basil was fresh , as were at least part of the tomatoes . but the soup had a thick , almost chunky consistency that made me feel like i was eating a bowlful of marinara sauce . i seriously considered asking for a side of pasta . instead , i sent my soup back half uneaten , paid my bill , and left . i don t know if i ll be back , since the menu seemed pricey and i didn t see anything that really piqued my interest .

0,customer service is rude and they are put out to pick up their dumpsters . i ll never use them again . 
0,"i hate going to any umc quick care . take out the last two words and that will sum up my review . . i came her because i had extremely bad cold , upper respiratory , ear , and nasal infection . it took hours to get seen . they even checked to make sure i didn t have a uti ? ? ok put urine in a bottle and check . the doctor came back and said no uti . . . no kidding . then he wrote me script for cough med and meds to handle my infection . i later found out that the med for the infection were primarily used to treat uti s what the heck , i didn t have a uti . the side effects were so horrible i won t go into details of what it did to me but i can tell you , it was worst than the bronchitis and cold mixed together . i almost went to the e . r . just due to the side effects . this town is horrible for quick medical services and you have to wait a week or longer to see a primary doctor .

0,"decent food but horrible customer service . the waiter only tended my party twice to sit us down and to take our order . service was very unprofessional . no water refills until we raised our hands to ask for it . sometimes , we couldn t even spot any waiters except for the owner who seemed to be enjoying her lunch at the table in the corner . same goes with the bill . we waited until we couldn t anymore and had to come to the register ourselves to get the bill and pay it . nlike mentioned before , the food is decent . at least the hu tieu my tho kho that i always get . as for the portion size , it seems like it has gotten smaller . n npho van can really become great if they put more effort in their customer services .

0,went to go have a nice dinner with my husband before we went to the movies . it was when we walked up to the door and were yelled that they were closed very rudely by the manager . we asked what time they closed he replied . we brought it to his attention that is was before . he said he didn t care and we couldn t eat . i have never been treated so rude before . 
0,"tl dr expensive , not very good , they tend to overcharge you if you don t watch your ticket . n ni ve had them a few times over last semester to try them out , i ve been dying for a really good burger joint on campus . first time i had a burger , fries and a drink . totaled over . i found the burger to be over salted and overdone , but the fries were tasty . n ndecided to try them again later in the semester , giving them a second chance . tried the sliders this time you know , signature item . again , they were way over salted and i found the same thing happened to me as a previous reviewer , i was charged x . for the cheese on them and other prices were higher than the menu board even x . for cheese is a bit high for slider sized burgers . n nwell , in all i m sad that there still is no good burger joint on campus .

0,"this place became absolutely horrible ! it used to be a good hang out place with nice people , service and drinks . make no mistake , this is not what it used to be ! ! ! service is awful , ignorant and inattentive bartenders and servers . what s worst is that there are always a few dumb dumbs that will be happy to kick you out if some low life waitress have been pointed out that she can t do her job . not a good business strategy ! but , hey , if you re up for a bad and rude service , and willing to pay for it , welcome in ! . . .

0,"i would have loved to give my former favorite place a star rating , but after yesterday they are lucky they got a . i have been going to polished for a long while now and have been very impressed with the quality of my pedicures . i started going before my son was born and have brought him with me the last times . he is an infant and just quietly sits on my lap . i called and made my regular appointment for yesterday drove all the way from north las vegas when i arrived there was a sign stating to the effect kids are not welcome . . . please find daycare before you arrive . i asked why they didn t say something when i made my appointment and i was met with complete disdain . i can understand that children can be noisy and run around . . . i get it , but an infant that barely says a peep ? we have never had a problem . i used to hand out their cards to everyone and tell people how great they are . . . . now i will not refer a single person there and will let all my coworkers and mothers i know not to patron their salon . it is too bad . n nnow before someone jumps all over me for bringing my baby . . . . i am a single mom who works hour days during the week . i save up just to spend a little time on myself once every month or so . i am not about to dump my baby off at yet another daycare babysitter just so i can spend an hour to get my toes done so i can actually feel like a human once in awhile . n nnow i have to find somewhere else to go . . . not sure when i will have the time . i guess feeling pretty is reserved to those who are not single mothers or are willing to let their children not only spend the work week at day care , but also the weekends too in the eyes of polished .

0,"i have friends that live out in this area and have had those sad moments of having to stop at walmart . i think all walmarts are nasty . but this one takes the cake ! they have a little paper hung up in the restrooms like somebody is cleaning the bathroom every hour . lmao ! ! ! what ever ! i had to use the restrooms so badly one day and had to use their restroom . it stunk , as usual and it looked like a pack of monkeys went through it trying to distroy the place . there are knobs broken , funk growing around the toilets , nasty stuff smeared all over the place and toilet paper all over . the ground is always wet by your feet . . . . there wasn t bathroom stall that i could go into and even clean up a little to use the restroom . i ended up having to hold it till i got back to my friend s house . i swear , everytime i go to walmart we all catch some kind of cold or stomach bug with in days later ! n nquality of their products i used to work in a distributing warehouse a long time ago and i can tell you , you get what you pay for ! name brand companies like fisher price , v tech , even sony , etc make lower quality products specificly for walmart to sell so they can be cheaper than everyone else . they sell them in huge truck loads to all the walmart s , so everybody wins , if you can t afford the better quality same exact product one that they produce for other stores . so when you see the same item at baby s r us for instance and it is more expensive , it s because it was made with better quality and probably has less pieces or thread count or whatever . nanyway , just saying , it s worth it to pay a little more to get better quality , better service and not get sick everytime you go shopping ! n ni do however try to go there every other month and i load up on paper goods because they are the cheapest in that department and i am not too concerned about the quality of paper towels , tp , paper plates , diapers , etc . . . n nhappy shopping !

0,"i have been swimming my entire life . nbut for the first time i got a severe rash after i went into this pool . it starts on my legs and my arms and is up and down my arms and legs . it consists of small bumps . it is so itchy that it usually becomes a more or less continuous rash within days , worst on my upper legs . ni went back to the pool the day after and talked with a staff but she told me perhaps it is because of high chlorine and i can check the water first for the chlorine level and it is my choice to use the pool ! ! nbut without a measurement device how i can tell it is safe for me or not ! nif you are looking for a toptional pool it is great but i do not like to have a swimming pool rash again and definitely i will go back to venus in cesar palace like before .

0,"came to this bar on a whim was hoping for a better atmosphere and was disappointed . my friends and i were looking for a place to relax and watch the baseball game and when we asked the server if the tv could be changed we were told we have to wait for the hockey game to be over . even though there were tv s showing the game with no one watching it . sure no problem , then we asked another server what kinda of wheat beers they had on tap not only did she have no idea but she also did not know the prices to what she was offering . the menu did not have beers prices hence the reason why we had to ask . then proceeded to stand around and gossip with the other girls , while the bartender threw ice cubes at the waitresses . i gave this restaurant stars for their employees lack of knowledge before putting them on the floor , and not being very attentive .

0,"i love matt s big breakfast downtown , but this was a huuuuge disappointment . huge . i ordered an egg salad sandwich which i have had before at the one downtown , and it was just awful . there was literally no egg salad in this sandwich . the two slices of bread on the outside where so unnecessarily thick . i took off one of the slices in attempt to actually taste the measly amount of egg salad that was on my sandwich , but even then , the other half of bread was so rubbery i couldn t tear it with my teeth ! i was in awe . even the guy sitting next to me said something about it . like wow that s a lot of bread . n ndon t get me wrong , their breakfast is fantastic at matt s downtown ! and maybe even good at the airport as well . but i have had their egg salad before and it was nothing like that . n ni almost complained to my server it was so bad . almost . i can t believe i spent money on like a tablespoon of egg salad . i never ever complain about food , i usually just don t ever return if i don t like it . but this sandwich was so pathetic i actually wanted my money back . of course i m so passive i ended up not saying anything . was just kind of hoping my server could tell by the fact that i barely ate any of it . i should have complained and i regret not doing so . i just hate to . but this was so bad . won t ever go here again . n ni still kind of want my money back . sorry guys !

0,"it s taco bell . . . a fast food chain . . . how anti yelp of me . i may even get a talk thread all about me as an example of all things wrong with yelp . . but i eat tb alot and frankly each deserves a different rating so why not give it a go ? n nif you need your fix of burrito with fillings from a caulking gun i would reccomend you drive to the next tb since they are on every corner and this one is sub par . my half pound cheesy bean burrito weighed nowhere near a half pound and while i can t figure out which layer was missing there were definately only layers in my layer burrito . n nthere is a del taco across the street what was i thinking ? n non the plus side when i say alot of fire sauce , i mean it and they complied .

0,"halfway through my night at the act i was thinking this is a really great time because it was entertaining , and different . unfortunately you can read about that in the other reviews , because i have to talk about how the staff at the act ruined my friend s birthday and our last night in vegas . n nwe brought in more than twelve people , guys in suits , girls in dresses , and we paid for wristbands to drink at the open bar . we arrived around . after an hour of dancing and watching the shows , a bouncer kicks out my friend and his girlfriend , no justification . he claims she was intoxicated when she was very clearly not . not wanting to cause a problem , my friends complied with being escorted outside , and waited to ask what was going on and why they were being removed . i guess calmly asking what the problem is doesn t work at the act . the bouncer just said he could remove them for any reason that he wanted , he didn t need to have a reason . are you kidding me ? we were couples who paid a hundred dollars and we had one hour in the club before our clearly sober friends were removed . interestingly enough this was when there was finally some action in the club and it was starting to fill up . i guess they needed space for the single people ? my friend was clearly targeted , although truly , we have yet to figure out if there was any real reason other than a greedy club trying to increase turnover . n nwe re a group of friends in our late twenties willing to pay good money for a fun , interesting , different kind of night we thought the act would provide . what was different is that we paid to be treated like garbage an have our night ruined . no one felt the need to come up with a reason for removing my friend and her boyfriend . n nwhat s worse is that we were paying guests of the hotel as well , but it seems that the staff at the act thinks that once they have your money , they can toss you out . we aren t loud piss drunk year olds . ironically there were several loud piss drunk year olds falling over that were allowed to stay . it seems that purchasing unlimited drinks at the act is a ticket to the door . n nsave yourself time , money , and embarrassment and go to xs or hakkasan . . . . or anywhere where they actually train and watch their staff .

0,"i lived a few blocks from this place for years , and only went there a handful of times when it was completely necessary . i can probably count them on one hand . it was always chaos in there . n ni actually walked in there at midnight days before christmas once and it was destroyed . i understand it is going to be a litte hectic during the holidays , but there was no effort being taken to keep the place presentable . i don t mean items misplaced , but literal spills of who knows what just laying around , it was insanity . at midnight . i got what i needed and left asap .

0,"my overall review for this location of brueggers is star . but , i must say . . . when you actually get what you ordered , the food is quite good . i prefer brueggers over einstein s any day . the bagels are softer and i enjoy their flavors better . n nbut , one can only describe a trip to the brueggers at th and camelback as either a trip to the twilight zone , an episode of candid camera or a stint on punk d or a combination of all of the above . the employees are friendly enough , and it seems to be locally owned and operated , but the employees are slow , inept and downright stuipd . i hate to call anyone stupid , but there really is no other explanation . you must repeat even the simplest of orders at least three four times and only order one item or sandwich at a time . no matter what type of bagel you ask for , they grab a different one and you have to nicely inform them once again of the kind you wanted . if you ask for no cheese on the sandwich , they put it on any way . ask for bacon ? you get sausage . it s really that bad . n none trip , i ordered two sandwiches . knowing their level of service , i ordered slowly and asked for one sandwich at a time . the employee asked me three times what type of bagel , four times if i wanted it toasted and still got it wrong . i seriously felt i was on mtv s boiling points . n nmy last three visits , i brought the food home only to find the order was wrong . n ntoday , i ordered two bagel sandwiches . one was correct , the other was totally wrong , after reminding the employee three times of what i wanted and after stopping him from grabbing the wrong bagel . n ni live nearby , its a convenient location and the food is good . the service sucks . n ni typically go on the weekends , but i have friends that work in the building , and they have had similar experiences during the week and have stopped going . n nyou have to experience this for yourself . words seriously can t describe .

0,"ian s has to be one of the most overrated pizza places i ve ever been to heck , i think most of the restaurants in madison are ridiculously overrated . maybe i am in the minority as a couple others might say , but some of ian s unique pizzas are pretty disgusting take the cordon bleu flavor for one , i couldn t even eat a bite of it without gagging . i also have an issue with the price the slices are rather small , but then again , i m not sure if i want a big slice of mac and cheese pizza anyway . n nthe only charm to this place is the novelty of the awful pizzas and the fact that they can make a halfway decent traditional pizza , but if anyone wants ian s again , i m running out !

0,"if you re thinking about eating here , there are almost certainly better places you could go . i ordered the chiles rellenos and was pretty disappointed . ingredients seemed low quality and overall preparation was subpar . everything was drowned in a red sauce that tasted canned . i have made this dish better at home . the place also isn t kept up very well , and the view from the patio where we sat was a little depressing . however , our server was a really nice guy . overall i d give the place one star based solely on food and atmosphere , but i bumped it up to two for the service .

0,"this has to be the worst mexican food in las vegas ! ! ! i ordered the chimichanga with chili colorado . it was canned refried beans and meat . it was topped with black olive and a gigantic glob of sour cream , making it a soggy mess . the chips were like styrofoam , and the salsa tasted like something from the generic section of walmart . the best part of the meal was the ice water . the slop they serve at taco bell and robertos is far superior to this place . other reviews talk about the margaritas if i had had enough of these , i might not care about the food here . the only positive was the waitress , who was very nice and attentive .

0,"i never even made it into this salon i wanted to try it i really did . i called to let the stylist know that i had found them online and wanted to get pricing on a shampoo , cut , and style . while i did get the pricing , the woman acted like being on the phone with a potential new client was the last thing she wanted to do . n ni asked her if she does saturday appointments , she responded yes we do , . . . silence . . . silence . . . silence . . . silence you get the point . i m thinking o k , guess you re not going to ask if i want to make an appointment . i thanked her and ended the call . n ni have always had a good rapport with my stylist , and it started with the first call . first impressions are lasting and the impression she gave me was that i needed to try another salon !

0,"wow ! tastes just like the gyros i ve had in chicago ! in my high school cafeteria ! n nblech . gyro meat had the taste and consistency of pulped newspaper and seemed to be comprised entirely of nothing but pure fat and ground up unwanted animal parts . can t say i ve been in their establishment i got delivery but that pressed meat tasted more like it was rolled off of a steam press factory line than as if it was cut off of a spit . save yourself some money and buy a box of frozen , pre cut gyro meat . it ll compare in quality and probably taste better too . n nfries were greasy , soggy , floppy , and all around nasty , as if they had been sitting out for hours if not days . think microwaved fast food . the guy who took my order sounded like he had just taken ten hits off of a gravity bong . n nseeing as athens gyros caused me to spend the rest of the day puking , i won t be ordering again anytime soon .

0,"i have nothing more to add , but i don t want anyone to think only a few people had complaints about this poorly planned festival . n noh , wait , i do . n ni was there with my year old grand daughter and my daughter , since there were going to be kids attractions as well as the food trucks . i thought it was nuts that minutes of jumping around cost . but i guess it was consistent with the water and beers . n nand it would help if there was some roadway controls and or temporary signage . by am , traffic backed up down pima from the event to indian bend and over towards the . cars were skipping ahead and cutting into line , further delaying entrance . n nif success is measured by interest , the festival was a success . if by performance and customer satisfaction , not so much . and how can a vendor commit to showing and not have enough food to feed the presold ticket holders ? why risk your hard fought reputation ?

0,"alliance owned properties . . . no thanks . you did such a bang up job robbing us at broadstone apartments that i will never live , own , or opperate with any alliance property . you want nearly a grand for the property at symphony apartments and not only was your office staff rude and un polite while showing us the grounds , when we asked who manages you and you stated alliance we both laughed out loud and said no thanks , with snide comments being said about us as we walked away . n ndo not deal with alliance .

0,"location is great but service was just ok . food . . eeh . had the cajun pizza looking deal and it was not spicy at all . sat upstairs in patio , group of older women directly next us started smoking not cool plus it is just too tight of an outdoor upstairs dining patio to allow smoking . n nya not impressed , many other places in same location w better ambiance .

0,"i used to really like this restaurant located in a strip mall across from unlv . it s a cute small hole in the wall with some sort of ambiance tables booth seating . my husband liked it and we even ate here with my family and friends . the service was excellent . the portions were good . the pricing was good . one lady was doing prep work vegetables at one of the dining tables , which was kind of weird . don t get me wrong , the food was excellent . however , when we saw bugs the last time , we got a little turned off .

0,"don t buy here ! ! ! they are liars and cheats . i brought in my hp laptop i bought at this store . to the geek squad because it wouldn t power up . they said they had to send it to kentucky for possible repair at a cost of . . a week later kentucky called said it was to old to fix it is years old i should buy a new one . so i did . i gave the old computer to a friend , he changed the battery power cord voila ! ! ! ! it works fine ! ! ! ! ! really ? ! ? ! luckily i hadn t picked up the new one yet so they reluctantly gave me my money back . never again will i use this store .

0,"horrible shop ! unprofessional , rude , and not good crew . their customer service sucks ! they don t keep their appointment they make plenty of excuses ! also , they have horrible personalities ! makes you never want to go back . do not go to this place ! "
0,"an extremely disappointing visit for me and i won t be back . nthis is quite sad for me as this little hidden gem is really beautiful inside , light and airy with tasteful decoration . i was here with a few work colleagues for lunch and upon arrival , bread and butter was placed on the table . i asked the waiter if there was any flora or suchlike his nostrils flared , his mouth pursed as he told me with disgust that there was not . fine , but when a customer has explained a lactose allergy then it would be nice to try and accommodate that ? nthis set the pace for the rest of the meal . there was almost nothing on the menu that i could eat . neveryone else dining with me seemed quite happy with their food though so if you have no weird dietary requirements then give it a bash . "
0,"after hitting some other places and experiencing wag n wash more i have to lower my rating . there are two main issues that annoy me . n nthe staff pay is apparently commission , or at least sales , based . which means that they will not leave you alone to just look around and make a decision about products ! this would be less annoying if they were trained better i have received conflicting information from two different staff members about the same product . . . that raises a flag . one of them is wrong but they are really trying to sell stuff to you ! n nfurthermore , their dog wash area is nice and well kept . however the dog baths require you to get your dog into them . which is tricky if you have a big dog , especially after the wash when the floor is wet and you have to get the dog out . after my first experience , when my dog slipped , i asked a staff member if their was a better way that might keep my dog from hitting his legs when he slipped . . . they just nonchalantly said that it was what happened all the time . n neven better , the drying area is separate from the washing area and requires you to take your wet dog into another room , lift them onto another platform and then use the driers on them . why not just dry them in the tub ? n ni d suggest going to smelly dog up the street , their tubs lift up for you and you dry the dog right there , also their staff is happier and friendlier ! "
0,"not really happy with the accommodations , they have seen better days ! i don t like sleep number beds and the cleaning staff would come at random times of the day . i wouldn t recommend this hotel . "
0,"i would give this restaurant no stars ! it was awful ! the owner was mean and didn t believe my husband and i that there was a fruit fly that flew out of his rice . the owner insisted he didn t have flys or mosquitos in his kitchen . he was rude and showed no customer service . i read several reviews on here on the lemons and mine had black spots on them as well . when i ordered my food it was very bland and cold ! we had to wait to eat our food because the waitress didn t give us forks right away and we had to continue to wait for everything . the forks , the check , the drinks , etc . i would never eat here again . customer service goes along way . oh , and the sign outside says authentic mexican food but there is nothing authentic about it . it taste like taco bell . i order a beef chulupa and got some kind of mystery meat . "
0,"it s been a couple of years now since the panera bread corp of st . louis got dan patterson to sell out completely . however , i can assure you he and his family were the only ones to have benefited . nquality has gone so far down hill . you can just tell the ingredients are more processed and a manager confirmed many of their food preparations like dressings , toppings and sauces are made in a central kitchen in another state of highly processed quality with plenty of food additives . nthat spinach power salad i ve been belching up that garlic flavor in that poor excuse for croutons for hours now . nyou can tell this place is more about corporate up selling as well you can t walk through the line without some poor under paid employee half heartfelt trying to push their over priced cookies and deserts on you . n nwhat a travesty , i remember when this was a great local chain that prided itself on its quality . no longer , it s lost to an enterprise only interested in the bottom line where corporate strategy includes lowering the cost and , ergo , the quality of food production . another loss for phoenix in the fast casual domain . this place is off of our lunch schedule during the work week and should be off yours as well . support something local and who maintains quality standards .

0,"my boyfriend and i came across a groupon they had , we had a trip planned and this groupon seemed great . n nthe place looked like apartment complexes at first glance , we checked in no bellhop to help with bags nif your staying on the nt floor your have to take your luggage up the stairs , and the stairs had a few shaky ones so it felt like you could fall n nwe checked in friday monday non sat the water heater went out so we had cold water the whole day nsunday it still wasn t working so someone had to come to our room and fix it nthen we put a do not disturb sign while in the room but when we would leave we d be gone for hours and i d call the front desk and ask to have our room cleaned . no luck . we stayed the whole time without getting our room cleaned . because no one would ever come . one night it got cold so i called to ask for an extra blanket n nthey didn t have any . n ncabs don t ever come around you have to ask the front desk to call you a cab and that takes awhile . n nif your looking for a quiet place this place is very quiet n nbut when in vegas and you want the casino feel then i d suggest you stick to a casino . nit was pretty depressing staying here to be honest and i was very disappointed n ni could honestly say my bf and i will not be staying here again . . . ever .

0,"in the past my husband and i have purchased several pieces from colleens . we ve spent roughly . so we consider ourselves to be decent customers . recently we moved into a new home so we decided to consign a few items with them one of them being a custom sectional . they charge to pick up and then give you of whatever they sell the item for , we found this to be fair . in the midst of our move we realized that the men who came to pick up the pieces left behind a cushion which is part of the couch , it can not be sold with out this cushion . we called immediately to let them know they forgot it . colleens has locations and unfortunately we do not live near any of them . we asked them several times to have someone come pick up the cushion and we were told they would . five days later , no one came . so my husband called again and spoke to a susan at the rainbow and cheyenne location . she was extremely rude ! ! she told my husband if you don t want to drop the cushion off we will have our delivery team bring you back your couch so we can just be done with this . he asked to speak to a manager and conveniently no manager was available . i am horrified at the customer service . we have been loyal customers for years now and to be treated so poorly by this woman is disturbing . we will never shop with them again .

0,"yelp is my go to for recommendations , but this is my first time writing a review . this was hands down the worst dining experience i have ever had ! i know , i know . . . i should have listened to the others , so i really have no one to blame but myself , but we had an entertainment coupon and it was on ddd , so how bad could it be , right ? ? ? the first red flag should have been the guy alone passed out in the booth . the server said he was waiting for his party to arrive and acted like it was totally normal for someone to be sleeping , with their mouth wide open in a restaurant . red flag number , besides him , there was only one other family in the restaurant , on a saturday night at pm . we ordered our food wee , not so wee , salad , and sausage sandwich and then we waited . red flag number , after we placed our order we had to give our dirty , paper menus to the people next to us that had just say down . i guess they didn t have enough to give them ? weird ! ! ! after waiting minutes we were starting to get really hungry and the restaurant was filling up . we asked about how much longer and the sever said any minute , but that they only had two ovens and there were a lot of orders . she laughed about it like it was a joke and when i said this is not funny , we are starving she said it s my job to smile in her snarkiest voice . this is when i started to lose my patience . my year old was starving , and at this point had eaten all of the snacks i had in my bag as were the rest of us . when we ordered our food , we were the only table in the restaurant that had no food ! the people next to us were already eating and i am pretty sure the guy passed out was not planning on eating . so why then was it taking minutes to get our food ! ? ! ? finally minutes later our salad came out , but we had no plates . then one pizza came out , but not the other . the two other tables that came in after us got their pizzas before we got our second pizza and our sandwich ! ! ! so half my family had no food ! the other half couldn t eat anyway because they use so much cheese it took forever to cool off enough to be able to eat it . the service was terrible and my husband had to get up four different times to get napkins , knives , extra plates , and a box . the tables are also ridiculous . every time one of us had to get up we had to move the table to be able to fit . we are regular sized people , but the tables are like picnic tables at a booth and the wood legs block you in . i have never had to move an entire table to be able to get out of my seat . when we were finally done no surprise the bill was wrong . they had said they would take off the sandwich because they messed it up shocker but it was still on the bill . as we got in the car to leave we all breathed a sigh of relief that dinner was over . i guess all you can do is laugh about it and of course yelp about it . thanks for reading !

0,"i came here on a friday night with my hubby and year old . this place is really huge with many rooms , and it is child friendly . they have a nice children s menu coloring book . the waiter we had was pretty good , he served us our food at a good time , and checked to see if we wanted more drinks or needed anything from time to time . ntheir margaritas were good , their complimentary chips and salsa were good , but the entrees we ordered were not good . i ordered their chika chika boom boom and it was ridiculously spicy ! my husband ordered an enchilada plate , and his was also way too spicy ! why was there no warning about how spicy their dishes were on the menu ? nit was hard to enjoy my meal since my mouth was burning . other than that , the service was ok , the decor was nice , but overall the food is the most important thing at a restaurant , so we won t be coming back to chuys . "
0,"this place is ridiculously expensive for meh food . i tried some lasagna , also had the quesadilla and some chicken strips . the food was fine , nothing special , but it cost a ton of money ! i have no idea why they charge so much , this is the simple casual place . there are many other restaurants in vegas with similar price points with much better ambiance and food . go to one of those .

0,"i went there with people to celebrate my big . food was good . nothing sensational but good . waiters were great . amazing service for dinner . n naround midnight , another people came to join us . bouncer made them wait way too long , about minutes and the place was half empty . . . so they just left . instead , he would let other people go in right in front of their eyes . go figure the place offers valet services and is filled with skanky girls . we heard it was a classy place but i would say it looked more as a cracked house with all those yukky girls . . . so they lost a lot of sales that night because we were planning to really enjoy ourselves . very disappointed , and they litteraly ruined my birthday . who would have thought that i was gonna cry of anger on my birthday day ? really hoping they are going to fire the bouncer doorman ! ! ! dont go people ! not worth it .

0,"this is the only buffet i ve been to on the strip . as such , the first visit was amazing . i d never had such an assortment of foods to choose from at a buffet . . . n nthe novelty has worn off . visited this place for breakfast lunch on a weekday , just as they were changing out the breakfast foods to lunch . it was a comp , so it s not like i was spending any of my money , but . . . i still feel like it was such a waste . the food was just mediocre , nothing to call home about . the first time was great probably because of the whole first time at a vegas buffet thing . n nthe food hasn t changed in the month period between my visits here . all the same types of pastas , same desserts , same salads , same soups , same meats and cheeses . probably will not be visiting again . next time , i plan on stopping by wicked spoon and bacchanal .

0,"this is about bad customer service . . . on a number of occasions now , i have called to order some food and the phone rings and rings . i pick up my food because of the distance i live from domino s and today , since they didn t answer the phone , i stopped in to place my order . no one was there . . . there were no customers and the only cars were those of the drivers . . . so , i asked why they didn t pick up the phone . . the response was we re been really busy , really ? . n ni ordered , left to run an errand , and when i returned minutes later , guess what . . . still no customers , and no one working anywhere within eye sight . . . nothing . . . n nperhaps , being in a small town , they think it s okay to not answer the phone . . . well , they ve just lost my business and if other people feel the same way , maybe they ll get the point . . . probably not . . .

0,"this place was terrible . they took minutes to seat people in a near empty restaurant . n nanother minutes rolled by before they even took our drink order . more minutes to actually get drinks . i asked one of the waitresses to get our waitress and she essentially ran into the kitchen to hide . i camped out at the kitchen so i could ask about the holdup as it was now over minutes for food . n nthe food finally came out . some of the food was good , some was ok and some was mediocre . i had the patty melt which was flavourless and disappointing . my wife had the clam chowder which had almost no clams . we didn t see our waitress again until i tried to hunt her down . n na number of items were recorded incorrectly for who ordered them which made splitting the bill very difficult . n nif you think our service was bad , during our ordeal another table of was seated behind us and they left after waiting more than minutes for wait staff that never came around to even take their drink orders . they were followed by another group of who got their drinks quickly but then were never spoken to again . they paid their drink bill and left , shaking their heads . n ndon t bother wasting your time here .

0,"i came here with a bachelorette party last weekend . we put our name on the list and the hostess said it would be minute wait for a table for . it ended up taking over an hour . we were given complimentary pretzel balls and fondue at our table as an apology for the long wait . the pretzel and fondue dish was delicious ! definitely one of the best things we had on the table the entire night . ni ordered the salmon which was ok but the portion was very small . someone ordered the gnocchi which was not good . the cannelloni was good but the portion was small . . . again . the salads were large and very good . to sum up the food , it was ok but not great and we were all still hungry after we left the restaurant . nthe music playing was also extremely loud . you can barely have a conversation in the place . we were very happy when the live music started . it was a nice touch and the band was very good . nthe ambiance is ok . beautiful long tables and leather couches and gorgeous chandeliers . ni hate giving this place a bad review , but i would never spend to eat here again .

0,"this my first place under my name after moving out of my parents home . it was great at first but it was all an illusion , me and my boyfriend at the time began to notice insect problems with mainly flies and everytime we requested maintanace to handle this they would never show up when sceduled . we ended up taking care of it ourselves . management in the leasing office are horrible ! ! ! they lied about a package that was sent for me but i wasnt home to recieve because of work so they dropped it off at the leasing office and they i went to pick it up they said nothing was there for me when there was a note saying to pick up my package at the office . they had f we recent requested to know what balance was to get a money order for and they ended up giving us any amount that wasnt including any fees so we then got a fee because of their stupidity what normal human being wants a balance minus fees , the reason to stop all fees . i would rather pay more somewhere else to get something nice instead of going there because its cheap . i will not renew my lease .

0,"so thought i would give wimpy s a try with the family . . . the drive thru was extremely slow . but that was the best part of my experience . . i ordered burgers and two of them were made correctly . still not a bad thing ! as we began to eat the burgers my wife and i noticed our burgers were undercooked and was able to microwave it and eat it . my sons burger on the other hand was red and cold . . . even after microwaving it , it still wasn t done . leading us to think it might be frozen . . . by this time wasn t feeling the love . the fries were ok after they began to cool down it tasted like oil as if the fry oil wasn t hot enough and the fries just soaked up the oil needless to say most of our food went into the trash . . . n nohh yeah and i forgot about my drinks . . none were marked and they weren t even full . . . n nwhile in the drive through i noticed two younger children in the kitchen and many employees wearing hats but not hair nets . . one girl constantly removed her hat and her hair was all over the place . . . no one had their hair pulled back and out of the way . it looked scary , should have trusted my gut when i saw this and left . . . . n nthe owner needs to change a lot before they go out of business !

0,really bad service . ordered water waited total of min . than after i requested regular soda drink same thing and never got refill ha to ask for refill . also after we finished appetizer a waitress didn t even bother picking up the plates . so we had to battle with the table space . sushi wasn t even properly wrapped . a salmon that we ordered was still cold inside and dry . i told waitress and her response was ok . i give this place two stars . i give an extra star just for the set up . besides that food is bad . and service horrible . owner should focus on who they hire . just advice . it s a great location . but just an advice

0,"if you have ever been to the patterson house in nashville , you will definitely be disappointed with this place . drinks were way overpriced and tasted worse than drinks i have had at a college bar . "
0,"worst customer service ! after waiting close to hours for one pizza , i waited an additional minutes on hold when calling to find out what was going on with my order . i hang up and then call back . a different person answers and asks to put me on hold . . . i tell her no . she says there are multiple lines ahead of me and that she is there alone making pizzas . i said miss , you re not alone . another guy answered the phone ten minutes ago . she said current wait time was an hour to an hour and a half . i said its been almost two hours to which she replied she was sure my order was on its way . i said check please to which she said she did and that its on its way . and then added they are really busy because of school lunches . i said not my problem miss . if you can t handle the volume , don t take it on . pizza is still not here btw . . . don t use this store ! ! !

0,i love the qs l in concord . the wait staff is great and very accomadating . have never had any issues there . the pineville location is so terrbile . they have ghetto fabulous written all over it . the wait staff walks aroung like they are lost and have nothing to do . the wait staff are dressed in the uniforms but they look sloppy . they charge extra for every little thing you ask for . the wings are so drenched in sauce they are soggy by the time they get to your table . we waited minutes before anyone came to our table and in the end we had to grab a waiter . the worse experience i have ever had at a restaurant . i will make the drive to concord for the better experience . i do not recommend pineville location . go to concord . 
0,i had a coupon that i purchased online . i brought it into long wongs which was for an extra large pepperoni or cheese pizza and dozen wings . i gave the coupon to the bartender and she said she didnt know how to process that and the owner would have to do that . i asked her if there were free refills on the sodas and she said yes . i said ok and the owner put the info into the computer and then said what do you want to drink . i said one diet coke and regular cokes . he said ok i will give these to you . they were in paper cups w lids and straws and said coke on the outside . there were of us in there eating . my friend and her bf and myself . i told him i wanted light on the sauce for of it and he said i have to put some sauce on it . i said yes light is some sauce . i told him to do light on sauce for the cheeese andpepperoni for the regular . the bartender brought us out the dozen garlic parmesan wings that we ordered . then she brought out the pizza approx mins later . she asked if we were ok and needed anything and i said some more napkins . my friend went up to get myself and her a refill . then she asked later if everything was ok and my friend asked her for to go containers . she brought out a couple and my friend put the rest of the wings in there . we left and then a few mins later my friend realized she left her cell phn there and she went back and she said the bartender told her sm turned it in . anyways the next day the owner called me times on my cell phone from a i didnt recognize . it wasnt the business phn . i finally answered it wondering who kept calling and didnt leave msgs . then the owner accused me of not paying a bill . i told him i gave him my coupon for the wings and pizza and he said i didnt pay the bill . i said we didnt receive a bill and then he said i had to pay him for the drinks we received . i said there were only of us in there . then he kept changing the amount he said i owed . and was harrasing me telling me he was going to call the police on me and press charges for the sodas . i said if i would ve gotten a bill for the sodas i would ve paid it but i didnt . i told him that he told me he was giving me the sodas . he kept changing his story around and i will never ever go back there bcuz i was treated like i was some kind of criminal . i dont need to be harrased and aggravated from sm that is very unprofessional and rude like he was . i give this place thumbs down ! ! !

0,"i have been to this kneaders location no less than times since they first opened . each time i said it was time to write a yelp review but once i got home , i tried to overlook the poor , unfriendly service that i received . today is the day i write a review . n nlet me start by saying , i always go through the drive thru . of the time , the service has been less than friendly and many times , i felt that i was putting the employee out by even using the drive thru . i have waited as long as minutes in the drive thru cars ahead of me only to be greeted at the window with , . . no , sorry for the long wait . . . . . . . no thank you for your patience . . . . . nothing ! on numerous occasions , the bag was handed to me . . . . here you go and the window was shut on my face . i found i was the only saying , thank you . i ve come to the conclusion , they place their most unfriendly and rude employees at the drive thru window . i don t take it out on the employee because obviously , they have not been trained properly in customer service . n ntoday , around am , my son went to kneaders to pick up lunch . i have posted a picture of how they packed the bag full sized sandwich , an order of french toast and an order of bread pudding . they were not placed in bags or flat in the bag but they crammed all of it in one bag , on their sides ! the inside of the sandwich slide out of the bread and was loose in the plastic container . the bread pudding and french toast . . . well , you can imagine how those looked . this is what prompted me to finally write a review . n ni watched this location being built and on the first day it opened , i went through the drive thru and spoke to a trainer who was here from utah . i told him how much i was looking forward to the restaurant opening and that ahwatukee needed a place like kneaders . n n ahwatukee is a small community within a large city . word of mouth goes a long way in this area . management needs to start reading the yelp reviews , respond and make changes accordingly . my next trip to kneaders will be to return my loyalty card .

0,"the fact that this airport absolutely sucks is a blessing in disguise . i love vegas , and this pos airport is one of the only things that keeps me from visiting the strip on a monthly basis . n nit s old , it smells , the security lines are longer than space mountain on a sunday . no matter what day or time you fly in , it always takes forever to get a taxi . n ni just want to get off the plane , start pounding booze and get to my hotel without having to fight lines , crowds , and washed up hookers . . . but apparently that s asking too much . n nbut if you want to enjoy the bright lights of vegas , you have to suck it up and venture through this awful airport .

0,"for a second breakfast stop , my mother decided to sleep in conserve capacity while my aunt and i trekked to beauty s , the bruncheonette on the corner of mont royal west and st . urbain . perhaps not as famous as st . viateur or schwartz s , fans and the local media still place the small diner on the same best of and iconic lists and unlike the former , original owner hymie sckolnick is still involved as he approaches his tenth decade of life . n nwith an opening hour of am , and after a near ticket with a local police officer targeting people for taking left turns on a nearby street we arrived at beauty s perhaps fifteen minutes after opening and after looking at the myriad articles posted in the small entry way entered to find only a few locals sitting at the bar . greeted promptly by one of three servers we were led to a booth where menus were provided , coffee was ordered , and we were left to make our choices from a number of deli classics and a few montreal specialties such as the mish mash . n nsitting and browsing the menu as well as the space , beauty s is pretty much exactly what you d expect from an old school jewish diner kosher meats , a small selection of baked goods , and breakfast staples like pancakes , challah french toast , bagels , cream cheese , and lox in a room full of small booths and a long counter where short order cooks quickly and quietly put together breakfast plates while chatting with the clientele while friendly waitresses performed their duties expediently . n norders placed and by now working on my second cup of thin but well flavored joe as my aunt sipped on a large glass of fresh squeezed orange juice it would not be long before our first item arrived a small order of house made pouding au riz for plus a ml serving of pure maple syrup for . . realizing , of course , that profit margins at a place like beauty s are not that high and setting aside my general distaste for paying extra for a condiment i will say that the rice pudding itself was unremarkable in most ways a bit too thick , a bit too congealed , and not enough of the golden raisins to balance the lack of vanilla or sweetness . adding a bit of the syrup helped , but i also had to conserve for my main course . n nmoving next to the aforementioned mains , pancakes for my aunt and french toast for myself specifically apple cinnamon pancakes and challah french toast and the former once again proving the point that my aunt simply cannot and should not ever order pancakes as each disc was pleasantly golden but far too dense and largely lacking any semblance of apple or cinnamon flavor aside from the few small chunks of apples mixed into the batter . not one to fancy syrup but instead opting for powdered sugar or sugar on her cakes i think my aunt had anticipated cooked apples served overtop but instead was left high and quite literally dry for . . n nfor my part , particularly with the addition of the overpriced syrup which they did not even provide me in the special beauty s glass bottle , i have to admit that the . challah french toast was the star of the morning with the dense eggy bread nicely saturated with vanilla tinged custard and seared to a golden tan . slightly crisp on the exterior and just a bit wet in the middle there was nothing fancy about the toast just a good rendition of a classic making me wonder if perhaps beauty s is the sort of place where one should just stick to the script and order eggs and bacon . . . an answer i ll probably never know as i d be very hard pressed to return .

0,"i thought this place was strange . in the salad i ordered there is usually fish even though it doesn t say on the menu . luckily the server told me because i mentioned being vegetarian . the watercress beet salad was not my taste at all , and i normally love salads . i thought the sauce didn t match at all , because it was a rather heavy mayonnaise sauce with such a light salad . just not my style of food .

0,worst experience ever . we planned to stay nights . when we first walked in the ac filter looked like it hadn t been changed in years . the quickly replaced it . then the ac broke . instead of putting us in a new room they sent someone to fix it hours later and it didn t work . then it took about another hours to get us a new room . the new room had a huge leak in the sink and water went everywhere . on top of that the pool by our room flooded and they closed it . then another pool was closed for a private party . the main pool was disgusting . was super cloudy had floating bandaids and dead bees everywhere . then i went to speak with a manager and check out and no manager or assistant manager or any one of authority was available to speak with . i will never stay here again . it is also in a rundown part of town . 
0,i live down the street and i have been wanting to go to this bar . i am a huge diamondback fan and wanted to go inside to watch the game . it had the feel of a baker bar witch are regulars . took a while to get any service . the bartender was ver rude . she gave us a dirty menu and never came back to take our order . we were watching the game then the tv went out . i would not go back . 
0,"i was here for happy hour , but they were closed during posted business hours . the food may be pretty good here , but i ll never know because their door was locked . "
0,"it got two stars because meh . i ve experienced better . is an apt description of this place . i probably would have upped it to . if that were available , but that s it . n nso why the low rating ? n nstrike they don t take reservations . i could get over this for a place that s stellar , but i had a party of and it s tough to walk into a small place with a crowd like that without one . and . . . they didn t mention when i called ahead about the reservation that coming early to get my name on the list wouldn t help because they won t put your name on the list unless half of the party is present . n nstrike my party of was whittled down to since didn t want to deal with the no reservations thing . so they stuffed the five of us at a table for four . we were pretty cramped and chose not to order appetizers with our pizzas because there wouldn t have been room . the bar area was also cramped you can t sit there without getting hit every minutes by someone walking to the bathroom . n nstrike the first two strikes wouldn t have mattered as much if the food had been spectacular , but it wasn t . it was actually pretty bland overall . the complimentary breadsticks were more like crackers no flavor or anything special about them . i then sampled three different pizzas the sweet potato , the mushroom , and the prosciutto . the prosciutto was great , but the other two were lacking some punch . i dressed them up with the little bowl of red pepper flakes , but then they were just spicy . n nthe menu describes the pizzas ranging from as for one , which is a little off . it s definitely more than one person should eat , and not quite enough for two unless you order an app . i d recommend sharing one and getting an app if you choose to try this place . n nthere were a few good things about this place . the service overall was decent , albeit a little slow for a pizza joint . there s plenty of free parking . the wine list included some good selections oz pours just so you have an idea .

0,"probably the worst korean restaurant i have been to in vegas . everything is overpriced and doesn t even taste good . the all you can eat bbq isn t really all you can eat . there s a limit to every beef bbq like la ribs two for each person . also , i ordered the kimchi tofu and the pork wasn t fresh at all . i almost had to spit it out . . . will be my first and last time coming here . would recommend ginseng if you are craving korean bbq if you re staying on the strip .

0,"i know that some people really love dr . wilson . that is why i went to her in the first place . i have tried to wait awhile before reviewing this , so my anger would cool down . n nsome people that work in her office are nice . especially one of her nurses . ni cannot remember her name , but she is older and blonde and perhaps german . she is the best person that works there . nthe rest that work there all act as if they are doing you a favor by being there . nthe worst is shannon . she is beyond rude ! ni had surgery with dr . wilson about months ago now . i had the worst treatment of my medical life from this shannon . everyone i have ever talked to about this and has had dealings with her has said the same thing . nmy pain medication was never discussed just given to me in prescription . when i asked about not having heavy pain meds , just perhaps a relaxer . she actually started raising her voice to me and refused to explain anything . n nwhen i did have the surgery , i went to the piper center . they were wonderful thank you jesus . i do not know what i would of done if everyone had treated me the way i was treated at dr . wilson s office . n after my surgery , the dr . did not speak to anyone in my family about it . to say if i was dead or alive , nothing . they were all there in the waiting room . nthey saw her sail out the door and never return . nnot only did she not come to see me and check on me in the hospital the next day , she sent no one . nwhen i asked the nurses when the dr . was coming so i could go home . they said she is not , she does not do it that way . nno one ever came to see me , no one ever called me , or emailed , or sent a letter , nothing ! i had a serious surgery as well . nmy dentist called me the day after a crown to make sure i was alright ! n nwhen i went back to her weeks later , i said no one ever came to see me , or call me to see if i was alright . she the dr . said we do not do it like that . ni understand that she is good at what she does , but no bed side manner here at all . her staff is the same way . nthey treat you as if you are a welfare case . which of course i am not , everything was paid for in full . but , no one should be treated this way for any reason . n n nbefore i was even dressed from the exam , they were in the room preparing it for the next victim . that happened times ! on separate visits ! i am not kidding about that at all . just walked in the room of them with the door open and started getting it ready . n n ni do not care how good you are , you cannot treat people like this . i would never recommend this office to anyone . you would have better treatment at the vet !

0,"i haven t been to this place in ten years , but i recently stayed here for a convention . this place has really fallen from grace . the service is horrible , the rooms are outdated and not very clean . the water pressure in my shower was low and the tub was backed up gross . next time i have to go to a convention at the lvh , i ll stay elsewhere and take a cab to the convention .

0,"i m very confused about the glowing reviews for this place . my experience here was terrible . so i come around pm on a thursday night to get some southern soul food like i remember from my childhood . after all i grew up all over the south including louisiana , georgia , and south carolina . n nso i go to the back where the prepared food is and there are two people in front of me . i figure there should be no problem getting some food and being out of there in time to pick my girlfriend up from yoga at pm . the line is moving at a snails pace and minutes in i m starting to worry . i really want to try this famed fried catfish i ve read in these reviews . around minutes in i finally get to place my order for some catfish and fried okra it s been forever since i ve had some and i love it . i end up waiting a total time of nearly an hour and give up on the okra because somehow that was forgotten from my huge order of . . . two items . so i figured i ll just grab some macaroni salad that they had pre made and head out since i was supposed to pick my girlfriend up nearly half an hour ago . n nso we finally sit down to eat the food i brought back hoping that it makes up for the wait . i figure it might have been an off night , but if the food s tasty i m willing to give it a pass . no such luck ! the catfish is terrible . it s most definitely frozen catfish that they have tried to mask the flavor and texture of with the breading to no avail . the macaroni salad tastes like they thought it was supposed to be a dessert , so they piled on the sugar .

0,the food was absolutely horrible . do not get pizza ! or the buffalo chiken wrap . both were straight garbage . the staff was friendly and the place wasn t bad if you are going for drinks . . . just don t order food . ni hate saying never but i will never go back there .

0,"warning rent at your own risk , unless you have alot of time to waste don t care for poor rude service . the poor reviews i can truly believe . i flew into vegas to unfortunately attend a funeral . i think my flight was shorter than the total time to wait in line to wait to pick up the car leave the rental area ! i was even min late attending the service since there were so many issues with the rental company . i arrived hrs early into the airport prior to the service got to the rental place in min . with people in front of me a long line behind me , i finally get to the counter about min later . people were getting very upset taking their business elsewhere which i should ve done to spare me the headache . only representative available the old man that helped me had poor people skills couldn t even get into his computer because he couldn t remember his password . time to retire , that includes his attitude ! mind you , i only asked question is there a hour grace period ? imagine , i was patient the entire time i get attitude ? he answered repeatedly the time you check in is the time you bring it back . . . he must have had dementia or something because i could ve been good with a a yes or no answer , instead of his annoying parroting . n nafter i finally get done with him , i go downstairs to get my car . if you have the wild car , keep in mind prices are good because they choose your car . the attendant said to me i got the mustang convertible . i m sure most folks would be thrilled , but not if you have a small child ! i brought it to their attention in the booth the lady , cindy , didn t care said she would have to charge me to upgrade . i just requested a hardtop for safety reasons . didn t realize she went ahead charged me without my authorization . that is totally stealing ! another rep said it was ok to go with an alternate car , i got one in a lower category with a hardtop , but still within the request i booked online . sure enough , when i return the vehicle , there s an extra charge for my downgrade . i made a complaint by phone since no manager was readily available i was pushed for time to return to the airport . i speak with the thrifty phone representative , kevin , and he says the complaint will go to the general manager at the rental location for training purposes , but i will not be refunded . he too was not friendly on the phone the minute i said i had a complaint . n nwow , how is it that thrifty hires poorly trained uneducated staff ? you stand in a forever line , get attitude for it pay extra for a downgrade without my authorization after being told no charges will be filed ? really ? my one star is for the initial rate i got for that one asian staff who was trying to be helpful after seeing my grief . . .

0,"extremely long wait , when there was one other table only , we went in for dine in and left an hour and minutes later with our food to go . some of our food was even cold , although the atmosphere was pretty , it was a horrible experience . i ve only had other places that serve ethiopian food but blue nile was the only bad experience and bad tasting that i ve had . reading the other reviews tempts me to wanna give it another try , i am hoping maybe the time i went the cook walked out or something . . . next time ill make sure to have a whole evening free , bring my laptop with a film qued up just incase the wait is long again .

0,"let me start off by saying that the food was ok . service was awful ! ! ! ! ! ! if i were basing this solely on food , i d give it stars . pricey but somewhat worth it . . . somewhat being a key word . nhowever , the manager responsible for the night when i visited for my bachelorette party makes me wish we had not wasted our time here . our group got nothing but salads and burgers and it took over mins for our food to arrive . when the manager came over to explain that it would be another minutes , i complained that we were going to lose our reservation for our next appointment and i didn t understand why it was taking so long . n have you ever dealt with food ? then you know that a well done burger takes over minutes to cook since this is not a run of the mill type of restaurant was his answer to my complaint ! yes , i ve dealt with food before . i love cooking and i ve never taken over mins to cook a burger well done or not . then he rushed us once we got our tab and urged us to go to our next appointment quickly . our server was not terrible aside from the fact that maybe he forgot to put in our order ? we never did figure out why our food took so long but if this is the type of service we received from the manager , i wonder what would ve happened if we had complained to the server himself ! nso dissappointed . we were badly treated and received no apology for it . would never go back to this place .

0,been here a couple of times since living here for years . now i know why . . . service is pathetic . obvious return business is not their priority . ordered a baked rigatoni with sausage and an appetizer basket for carry out . mind you the rigatoni supposedly comes with a cheese blend . got home no sign of any type of cheese except the grated parmasean cheese i used from the counter . i decided to save this dinner and return it . i came back the next day showed the lady the problem . and all they can do was make another one . not return my money and make another one for my inconvinence but just wait min and it will be out . not even an apology . today will be the last time i step into this place . no return business here . how they were in business since is a mystery to me . metro pizza far better pizza and quality of food . pricier than verrazano but its worth it for the food and service .

0,"my husband and i went a couple of weeks ago to this restaurant as we had heard from a couple of people that it was a good place to go to . maybe we just went on a bad day because it wasn t that great . we went on a friday evening and the place was nearly empty . our drinks arrived pretty quick and our order was taken , but i noticed that other people had the loaf of bread we seriously asked about different waiters where our bread was and they all said the same i ll get it for you right now . they would walk off and minutes later . . nothing . well we never got the bread and when our food finally arrived . it was bland , cold , and dry . we did order a dessert to split and that was actually the only good thing about the experience . . . "
0,"wouldn t recommend this company for a segway tour . they appeared to be rushed , not very knowledgeable of downtown and the areas that were toured were uninteresting . "
0,"i went to edo last night with two friends . i believe we choose to go there because one of the girls i was with loves hibachi and the prices are cheaper than ginza . in this case , lower prices means lower quality . n njenn and i split a spicy tuna roll and both ordered udon noodles . bailey ordered shrimp hibachi . the salad was typical of a japanese restaurant , but bailey and jenn said the clear soup lacked flavor . our sushi was also bland . bailey s hibachi i guess had more of a teriyaki flavor which was not what she wanted . because i m not as experienced with udon , i thought it was ok , but jenn said she has definitely had better . n nall in all , it was a disappointing experience . "
0,"cold soup and absolutely filthy conditions those are really the highlights . n ni will say that the food here is usually above average , but this particular location is entirely skippable . if you do try it , get it to go because you ll stick to the seats if you don t . unless your kitchen at home is dirtier , then feel free to enjoy the slime here . n nalso , if it s helpful , there are no functioning highchairs when we visited . "
0,"is six inches enough for you ? the quality is there , but delivering it is something else entirely . n na new store opened near me , so i finally decided to give them a try . they offer six inch gourmet sandwiches for around with tax , no sides included . n nfor my first test , i went simple with the italian and the meatball sandwiches . n nnow the meatball sandwich was hot with melted cheese , but the amount of sauce was seriously lacking , coming across as no more than a simple condiment . the meatballs were flavorful , but dry , and the pitiful amount of sauce supplied could not even begin to bring these things back to life . you could tell the meatballs had never even touched the sauce before they came together in the sandwich . i can t tell you if this is normal , since it was my first visit , but the attempt was not good enough to get me back . . n nthe italian was a failed attempt altogether , and i will clearly blame the preparer , and not the restaurant . as in most sandwich places , as you move down the line , you are asked what you would like on you sandwich . i told him , lettuce , tomato , onions , pickles , oil and herbs , which he repeated back to me to confirm . the problem was when i got home the only one of the ingredients that made it to my sandwich was lettuce . . . . . no tomatoes , onions , pickles , oil or herbs . i had places that made mistakes with my order , however not this bad , and not with me standing right there at the specific time telling him what to put on the sandwich . maybe that is why the condiment area is hidden behind a wall , so you can t see what they are , or are not doing . n nfirst impression . . . not impressed with either food or staff . . .

0,i canceled my membership months in advance due to the fact the gym was in constant disrepair . come to find out they never canceled the membership . the representative i called was not helpful and i had to leave a message with a supervisor . he also didn t put me on hold and i could be hear him speaking about how he wanted to get laid that night . listen dude i am all for people getting laid but cancel my membership when i ask please ! i really wish i didn t have to give them one star . stay away ! 
0,"a big , ugly gray building does not make me feel awe inspired and magical the way a good live theater venue should . the insides are new and functional , but equally plain looking . everything is always very clean and in good working order but i just can t seem to get over the aesthetics of the place enough to actually enjoy myself at all until the curtain goes up . n ni will admit that the theater space has great acoustics and the other facilities are completely adequate . the staff volunteers are both friendly and helpful . the bar always has a long line during intermissions but that is typical of all theaters this size . n nbasically , i have no issues with the place i just wish that is was prettier .

0,"line is very long , but is it worth it ? no , because it took away an hour of my time waiting in line , and the return value was nothing because the food was meh . n nin my humble opinion , this place is only popular because of the hotel and not for the food . n nto reiterate , the food was either bland or salty . thankfully , we had the buffet of buffets deal for . after the discount for being a total rewards member and we got to eat at different buffets within hours . so for the price of it being buffet of buffets , it was only okay . if i had to pay for the original dinner price , i would be quite upset right now . do not pay full price would be my best advice . it simply isn t worth the price ! n nabout the food , only things really made my trip a little better n the fruits lame right ? n the middle eastern food section as many have mentioned was good n the cotton candy wow ! this was the only buffet i know that offered cotton candy ! n nother than that , nothing else stood out . you re better off saving your money and spending a little more on more noteworthy buffets like the wynn and or belagio .

0,"this past friday , i was downtown with some friends , one who had turned and had never been to a comedy club before , so why not ! tickets were only ! wow , ok , to see comedians from chealsea lately show , ok why not ! n nwe received for drink passes to go to the bar next door and they would give us a buzzer to get in prior to people waiting in line . ok that seems like a great deal ! umm . . the for has to be the same drink , the waitress somewhat rude , and kept asking if we wanted food . . nor did she tell us that we can bring the second drink into the show with us . . came and went , and they were still not allowing people in . n nwhen we finally got in , we got center area in the second seating area , so people were walking past us all the time ! and i mean all the time even with the comedians performing ! seriously , people don t have to get a drink that much ! at least , do it between acts ! but no , all through the show . n nso our waitress , rude and just unfriendly . . drink min . , of course some prices were not on the menu . . a coke in a plastic cup , seriously ! and then i was asked at least times , to get my nd drink , during the acts ! seriously , can i watch the show ! i just asked for a bottled water to go , she came back with the cap off , so i asked for the cap and she did bring me a new one . for water . i got the macaroni and cheese and it was just horrible for it to be . . so our check was around . i wouldn t complain , if it was good but it wasn t at all . and again , people in front of us the whole time ! even the waitress were standing in front of us , taking the peoples orders in front of us . and like everyone else , we had to wait afterwards for the bill which already had the gratuity added , nor did we add more , service did not deserve it . n ncomedians were ok , not as funny as i thought they would be . n nall in all , i probably won t go back . i went to standup scottsdale and had a totally different experience for the better . i would ve thought this club was in scottsdale and stand up scottsdale was located in phoenix .

0,"i was hoping this place would be better . i ate breakfast there with my family and it was not the best . with such a small breakfast menu , one would think it would be served rather quickly even if its made to order . take biscuits and gravy for example . that is a fast dish to prepare , but it still took all too long to make it to the table . the sunshine on a cloud , was anything but . it was dry and the yolk was overcooked and far from over easy . the muffins were great and very fresh , we would definitely return for those , but we will wait a while before trying breakfast meals again .

0,"food was pretty good , beer was cold but service was shitty at best . "
0,that was not a great buffet that i expected . they have simple food . so do not spend your money there . 
0," stars for the non existent customer service and the fact that there s a minimum to use your debit credit card . we come from la where there s an overabundance of filipino bakeries who bake pandesal and other delicacies fresh all throughout the day . though i frequent this area because of the filipino market next door , i have never been to this bakery before last night . we walk in and it s fairly empty , the cashier just stares at us , no smile offered not even a polite hello . so we proceeded to browse the store , i then asked her if they had fresh pandesal and according to her they only make their breads in the morning . i grabbed a bag of pandesal and cheese filled bread . she rang it up and then informed me i had to get more things for the minimum if i wanted to use my card . this irritated me even more because i rarely carry cash , i was forced to grab and spend more due to their required minimum ugh ! the worst thing is knowing that i will probably be back at one point due to the lack of filipino bakeries in las vegas . best believe i will have cash the next time i come though ! lol"
0,"i really never thought about writing a review for best buy until the other day . i haven t had any good luck with best buy ever , but the other day takes the cake for me . i ve always went to best buy not because of prices but because of location and it is the only music store left . never nice people , they lost my camera last year and to replace it so no luck at all . but on the other day i went in to get some ear buds replaced , i waited in line for ever seems like . while a employee just stood there and talked on the phone as if it was her day off and i was doing her a favor by standing there waiting . i waited a little bit longer and the line grew , finally a guy who looked like he just got off break came up and helped every body in line while she just stood there . i ve never seen a company have like people behind the counter and none of them know how to do anything . what s the point of having said people for a certain position when the very person you need to return something for you is never there ? i don t like best buy i hate it , i wish circuit city was still a store i m shocked that it s still a company to tell you the truth . i believe if they employed better people then maybe it would be a better store . but this one here , that was on independence that moved to matthews , it just suck .

0,not the best dining experience . would definitely select ruth chris or flemings instead . 
0,there were three employees there and only one was actually working . it took way too long to get items that don t require cooking . the hot fudge sundae was missing adequate hot fudge . the other three desserts were mediocre at best . not worth a second visit
0,"i cannot believe how anyone can like this place . may be the service was bad the day i went . i walked in . . . . then found that the place had a smell that was not pleasant . but , i got adjusted to that in a few moments . i found only or items in the buffet . none of them looked fresh . i tried this place only because of the other yelp reviews . i would never go there again .

0,silly overpriced place run by trust fund baby hobbyist hipster and frequented only by his like . fyi any of the goods can be purchased cheaper on line
0,"having been born in hong kong , and growing up on chinese dim sum in manhattan and flushing , queens , i ve become a picky dim sum guy , so dim sum in vegas is a must try . to be brief , was a little disappointed , the sui gow pan fried dumplings was just ok . this is also the second place i ve encountered in my travels where they add ground shrimp to their pork shui mai , usually there might just be a piece of shrimp on top of the pork . the ground shrimp detracts from the pork flavor . this is something i m not used to . there was no ha gow on the menu straight shrimp dumpling , again dissappointed . the pan fried noodles with barbecue pork was well made , very crispy , as it should be , but alas it was flavorless sauce was bland . the barbecue pork was passable . i guess alot has to do with what ingredients you can get in vegas . overall will satisfy your craving , but can t hold up to vancouver , ottawa and of course new york dim sum outside of hong kong . i was impressed they had congee , but didn t try it . my mom makes the best .

0,"if i could , i d give this place no stars . nasty , nasty , nasty . i ordered a breakfast burrito with only potatoes , eggs and cheese . simple enough right ? i got home and opened it up to find half cooked potates , wet eggs , and barely any cheese . oh and they added ham to my order along with tomatoes and scallions . i tried a bite and it was disgusting . i promptly threw the food in the trash . oh , and the price ? ? rip off . i can go to almost any berto s and get the same thing , done correctly , for just under bucks . . . they charged me over . i will never eat hear again . don t waste your money guys . . . . . taco bell has better food .

0,"after reading through a few of the other reviews here , my experience was not much different , though it does at least sound like airbridge is at least trying to make things better . n nfirst things first i booked my tour through viator . com , which actually does not name the company you ll be doing the tour with . the price ended up being less than , which was half of what i later learned airbridge charges if you buy directly from them . as per viator s directions , i called the day before the tour to find out when i would be picked up i found out that i would need to walk from my hotel palms place to the valet at the golden nugget , a minute walk , to meet the bus at am . n nthe bus was nearly minutes late , made several other stops at a number of other random hotels , and we were deposited at the airbridge terminal . i don t think any of us knew where we were , or why we had stopped we were offered no explanation , honestly . all i knew was that we were at a random industrial park for no apparent reason . we sat on the bus for nearly minutes , watching our bus driver smoke and chat with other drivers , again with no explanation given as to where we were or what we were doing there . n nfinally we were let off the bus and into a room in the terminal where we were shouted at by some random gentleman who basically just tried to upsell us on a variety of other things e . g . , helicopter tour , skywalk , etc . . from there we were sent into an adjoining room to check in , where we were asked for another for no apparent reason and given a couple of random slips of paper and a flimsy bracelet , and told where to go to reach our buses . n ni headed outside to the bus and settled into a seat , but was rather randomly and rudely told to move next to a gentleman who would not close his legs or keep his elbows to himself , so i was essentially jammed involuntarily into a smaller than usual seat for the entire ride . joy . n nthe driver did her best , but . . . well . . . bless her heart , whoever told her that she should be a public speaker for a living should be slapped silly . she had a terrible command of the english language , and many of her sentences almost all of which contained the phrases now listen , you guys , you know , and ok then , usually multiple times each were so tortured and nonsensical as to be incomprehensible . for example , as we began our drive , she told us that she d be our tour guide as well as your best friend if you want , and your bridesmaid if you need . what does that even mean . when there wasn t an automated recording playing , chattering away factoids about the passing landscape , this lady would pipe up , telling us barely comprehensible stories about things . i know she said ragtown about fifty times , but i couldn t tell you what ragtown even is to save my life . n nwe made a quick stop at the hoover dam bypass which was kind of cool , though the driver chastised us for not all being on the bus seven minutes earlier than scheduled . we made one additional stop for a bathroom break at a random mcdonald s in kingman , arizona , before continuing the rest of the way to the south rim . n ni suppose i was lucky i was meeting a friend at the natgeo visitor s center who had driven there separately , and i was not going to return to las vegas with the rest of the tour group . i informed the driver , who seemed offended that i would even say such a thing . not exactly the reaction i anticipated . i m not sure what affiliation , if any , skybridge has with natgeo , but the visitor s center is nothing but an overpriced tourist trap with a horrible lunchroom that wouldn t have been so bad if they had had more than one person working the entire line for the entire group . we did each get a lunch ticket for a free sandwich rice bowl pizza soup salad , but the driver seemed weirdly delighted that none of us knew that we would be getting this ticket upon arrival , actually taunting an australian couple who dared ask when they would be getting the lunch ticket . it was , in a word , bizarre . n ni was slightly wary of the concept of a bus tour in the first place at least i know now to avoid them at all costs in the future . this was not a great experience and i will not be seeking out anything similar from this or any other company for the foreseeable future .

0,this rating is for the counter cashier for the cook food . i agree with the comment that this ordering paying is just unorganized . i hate it when i was there to buy dimsum but ignored that those who are buying food on the right side of the counter . please add more cash register . 
0,"my first and my last time eating here the service was bad not to mention the server was hitting on me when i just wanted to have a nice lunch , i needed more soda but the server didn t ask if i needed a refill when my glass was empty , i had to go ind someone to get more and the food was good but could have been made better it taste like a tv dinner to be honest and the manager was super horrible i will not be coming here and i told everyone not to go here cause the service was horrible .

0,"i was really disappointed in the service i received for the price i paid . paid like for a car wash . my car needed it they gave me decent wash , but that wasn t what i paid for . not going back . "
0,"the food is very tasty but the service is very lacking . the servers are very friendly but not attentive at all . the last three visits we were never asked if we wanted a second drink or more tapas . it hasn t mattered where we sit , the service has been very poor . "
0,"giving this one star only because the guys who actually worked on my landscape project were really good . i suspect that there is no real knowledge of landscape or plants behind the desks . they talked about working with me and making everything beautiful . the brochures talk about commitment to your personal taste and their expertise . not true . talk is cheap , watch out for empty promises . ni think somebody bought a landscape app and went to a marketing class . not the quality , care or artistry that this company used to have . extremely overpriced for the end product .

0,"noisy , loud , bad food"
0,"had reservations and were excited to eat here . unfortunately , the kitchen was excruciatingly slow , and the waitstaff did not seemed concerned about the delays in the least . the food did not redeem the poor service scallops were rubbery , spinach overcooked . i wouldn t recommend fishers in the city .

0,"swing and a miss n ni noticed the little signs saying now open for about a week and was excited to try it out . really was looking forward to a nice , unpretentious bar with good food near my house . n nfirst the restaurant is just weird looking . definitely tree themed with a fake tree in the center of the dining room and a log motif on one wall but there is another space with an odd collage of manly movie stars brando , james dean , eastwood , connery and then there is a strange bamboo ceiling piece over the bar . just doesn t tie together well . . . n nthen the waitstaff , cute and little and all wearing denim overalls . really ? n nit was pretty empty and i grabbed a seat at the bar . i was the only person at the bar . four televisions on and all tuned to the same sunday night football game . i believe all the tv s were muted as music was playing . the place was also very cold the door to the patio and the windows behind the bar were all open and was mid s . my bar stool was very wobbly so i switched to the next seat looked like someone had pushed the back of the seat way back . didn t help me at all i tried to bend it back and that helped a bit . regardless , the two seats i sat on should have been removed and fixed . n nanyway i asked if they had any beer specials . nope . so i order a beer , nice selection . n nthen i order the smoked chicken wing appetizer with blue cheese dressing and the large bbq sample plate figuring i would take the leftovers home . came with a side of coleslaw and one more side , i decided to try their sweet potato waffle fries . n ni tried to connect to their guest wifi . website said ask your server for the password . bartender doesn t know . hostess and another waitress do not know . she comes back and asks me to try a password . no luck . three minutes later some guy who had been outside smoking tells me to try another one . not it . he tells me to capitalize the first character . still nothing . he leaves . n nafter about minutes everything came out at once . oy . food looked all right , nothing too exciting . the pulled pork and the baby back ribs were less than room temperature . the smoked sausage was hot and the brisket was warm . not a good sign . as far as i can tell the pulled pork was garbage being cold didn t help but it was bland , needed salt and was very mushy . tender is good , mushy is disgusting . the ribs were fine tomato based sauce helped a bit but they were fine . nothing to write home about but edible probably been better had they been served warm . brisket was good on par with mac s speed shop . smoked sausage was also pretty tasty and the only hot food item i was served . n nas for the sides meh . the waffle cut sweet potato fries are hard to screw up and the coleslaw was unremarkable . the dinner was also served with a jalapeno cheddar biscuit , it too was cold and way to dry . smelled much better than it tasted . bartender waited until i was empty before offering another beer . i need the other beer to wash down the biscuit bite that was trying to kill me . . . n nappetizer , dinner and two beers and tip came to if the place is still open three months from now i will assume they made substantial changes and will try them again but i am thinking this place will be shuttered before then .

0,"been here times and very disappointed . other than the ambience the food and service have been inconsistent at best . . . . tried everything popular on the reviews , nachos , brisket , pork belly sandwich , mac and cheese and my experiences have been exactly opposite . terribly inconsistent , greasy , and just super disappointed as a live blocks away . my waiter told me the owner makes their moonshine at his house . c mon , really ? bad luck or an off night . . . . times i don t think so . n nmy guess with all the reviews is that people have already made up their mind before coming here . i have wasted too much money giving this neighborhood spot another chance . if you want real bbq in north phoenix go to pork on a fork . n noh yeah . . . . . . . the owner parks his white range rover in the handicapped spot in the front . . . . . . nice touch"

0,"worst cheesesteak ever ! n nnote that you cannot get it without onions or green peppers because , and i quote , it s mixed in . um , ok . so , i took a shot . what i got was a cold roll with some sweet tasting , room temperature , pressed meat in it , mashed up with some onions or green peppers , topped with no cheese that was apparent to the naked eye or could be tasted , and some shredded lettuce and tomatoes . by comparison , the steak um product that you can get in your grocer s freezer section is fine dining . n nstay far , far away from this place ! we never throw away food , and this went straight into the trash in favor of frozen burritos . . . . ugh !

0," this is a extension of my previous review of all of my apple product and apple store reviews , i believe you can see my older review of the apple store and all of my gripes by clicking on some nearby link next to this review n nupdate n nwow i am seriously pissed now . n nmy mid macbook pro , as it turns out , was built with a manufacturing defect regarding the wiring to the battery damaging the top case that holds my keyboard . i found out that my old and what was supposed to be a reliable laptop intermittantly has issues with the keyboard and trackpad . it just randomly stops working ! n nlet me repeat that . . . both my keyboard and trackpad randomly stops working ! as in , not responding at all . the keys are still backlit with that trendy white lighting underneath the keys , and my logitech mouse that i have owned for two years still responds , but i cannot type shit now . tried moving my trackpad , nothing works . only my aftermarket mouse does anything . n ni noticed that a quick fix would be to close and reopen the lid , but so far i only managed to try this once because i am in the middle of a assignment at school . it happened before weeks ago , and back then i did a hard restart by holding down the power button . n nsearching google on the topic , i was appalled to learn that this issue has been prevalent for six years ! in fact , according to a lengthy twenty five page technical support thread on the apple discussion board , the most recent posting was on april th , , and the earliest post regarding similar issues was in january th , ! n nhere is the link https discussions . apple . com thread ? start tstart n nthat would be according to a date calculator , years , months , and days that this issue has been prominent and unresolved as a manufacturing defect ! in other words , , days have passed and the manufacturing issue has still not been corrected ! n nskimming through each page of the year forum post , the majority of the culprits points towards the shoddy manufacturing of the top case , battery wiring as well as the battery itself . over use , the battery has a tendency to expand , pressing and damaging the wiring against the bottom of the top case it s what goes over your keys on your laptop . n naverage price for the repair , which is not a guaranteed fix ? ! ? to . n nare you fucking kidding me ? ! ? a design flaw like this is worthy of a recall , something along the priority of general motors and faulty ignition switches . n nmy laptop is years old , i have no intention of buying a new macbook pro because recent posts in the forum discussion shows that even brand new post models with retina display also suffers from the keyboard trackpad shutdown issues . n ni have invested , of my student loan money in the year of to purchase this laptop , that i expect to be streamlined with what i thought was going to be superior engineering and design . a additional for applecare that has already expired roughly or years ago . n ni am not spending a additional more than a third of the original value of the laptop just to fix a design flaw that gets in the way of my studies i take online classes as well , which often have timed exams , i need every minute to ensure that i achieve grades that are reflective of the effort i put into my studies , disconnections caused by me closing and reopening the lid to make sure my laptop keyboard works again is not a acceptable excuse for a lower grade according to my accounting syllabus . n ni will not tolerate faulty design anymore . you can read my older reviews of apple stores and apple inc . to learn of my frustrations with dealing with this company . n ninstead of spending to make my keys work reliably , i am going to spend that money on a netbook that is not made by apple . n nshortly from the time i post this review , i will upload photos of similar frustrations reflected by other mbp users from the forum post .

0,"against my better judgement , we decided to give the place another try . again , another epic fail on their part ! there were only other occupied tables in the place , and at least other servers on duty . the bar drinks took forever . when the food came out , it was wrong and it damn near took an act of congress to get more drinks or refills . this place better get it s act together before the new restaurants open in the spring . bravo cucina will take all of what remains of their clientel . is there a way to guve zero stars ?

0,"i ve stayed in several motels while taking small trips . this was probably the least appealing one i d ever stayed at . you get what you pay for . so , i ll start with the good it s not expensive , it s near the stadium , and that s about it . now , on the opposite side of the spectrum , as soon as we arrived we spotted a few prostitutes , some unusual activity . . . etc . checking in was interesting , a lady having a bad day next to us , telling the worker she had just gotten in a fight , the workers weren t really pleasant , our room . . . an unpleasant odor , a dead cockroach on the floor , needless to say we weren t really comfortable initially , however we did not hear any disturbance through the night . on our way out , saw some girl who had just been arrested , some cops , a few swat members . . . oh and did i mention the police have their own designated parking spot in this motel . we survived .

0,"this review probably speaks more to the gouging of tourist in the phoenix area than anything else . first things first the budget staff were helpful and got me my cars pretty quickly . firstly , getting to and from the facility is an ordeal . best bet it is minutes each way to get to the rental facility for this place . at worst i waited minutes for the bus then minutes to get to the terminal on the bus traffic for some reason and almost missed my flight . most of the airports i go to are under minutes to the facility or on site . since budget doesn t run the buses they can t really help the situation but they signed on to this project . also the buses come way less frequently off hours and there s places to line up so if you re in a hurry you have to have your head on a swivel for where to go . n nthe other issue with renting a car in phoenix is all the taxes and fees . after a four day rental my taxes and fees were roughly . which came to an effective tax rate of on my rental car for four days . i do not know any other industry where this would be remotely acceptable . clearly this is done to gouge tourists and business people visiting the area and get them on the way out so they cannot complain more about this non sense . if you can go to phoenix and not rent a car , do it . otherwise you ll have to grin and bear it .

0,another huge disappointment . this place was recommended by a mexican employee in the vip office . i wouldn t be surprised to find out this meat is leftover from the carver station upstairs which i think is leftover from the top of the world . was definitely not the mexican food i m used to in san diego and even in mexico itself . the wait to get just a burrito was ridiculous long . i counted minutes before my eyes started boiling . not impressed by the handful of chips to make the burrito look like a good deal . i d be embarrassed if i were mexican to recommend this place . i told the girl i was disappointed and she took it as a racial insult . not the kind of sorry it was bad i was expecting . jandy is not qualified to recommend anything and i m wondering how she has a job there . 
0,"purchasing any document is super easy and they are helpful in regards to which type of document you need . however , once i had a question about what a line item meant in their deed , they completely changed their tune . before i could even finish the question , the woman responded that is legal information , we cannot give you legal advice . when i attempted to explain that i am not asking for legal advice , i am simply asking what they meant by writing their own document . again , you have to call the clark county recorder . really ? i have to call the clark county recorder to ask them what nevada legal forms meant when they created their own form ? awful customer service ! ! !

0,"my review is for baby swim only n ni used to love this place for my m old who is now m . my old rating would have been stars but i am annoyed because we had a lesson yesterday and for some reason the pool was packed . we had to share a lane with another class which is not really easy to do when you have a baby and you are in the way of the bigger kids swimming . it s unfair to everyone . n ni never have a problem with staff they are super nice . i guess my thing is they need more space . n ni do wish they would push my child to swim more like i have seen the other kids her age do at water wings . my daughter is clearly comfortable with the water when she is being dunked and laughing . n nwhen i asked the lady on the phone if she could be moved up to baby swim , the next class , she did not really give me a good explanation . n nif your child is between the ages of m m baby swim is awsome , but after one they start to out grow it if they love water .

0,first time over there . the patio was very nice and i was with a friend that i have not seen for years . i was expecting so much from this place and i was disappointed . the food was ok but i was expecting much more from this place . first and last time . . . too many good restaurants to waste money at this one . 
0,"incredibly disappointed . . n n nthe yelp reviews i ve seen on this page was the main reason i decided to go with them . they have them all over their shop and it seems like they are proud of all of the solid feedback . let s hope this one makes their wall too . . because not everything is cherry with every customer . n nmy ford explorer had an overheating issue and a check engine light on . i wanted both taken care of . n nthe initial quote for featured mostly tests and a few repairs . . . . end result ? still have check engine . . and vehicle is still leaking coolant and my car over heats . n n nd time around . . . . i get another bill for about . . wtf ? ! instead i paid another for the other repairs . . . end result ? check engine still on , vehicle is still leaking coolant and over heats . i went to the shop in hopes of finding a better solution since by this time , i could ve just gotten a new vehicle and saved me the grand . n ni understand it takes parts and labor to do the job . . . but when you drop , and neither of your issues that you came in to fix are solved , that s absolute bs . i wanted my money back or at least the job finished without me forking over another penny . and the main mechanic had the nerve to say i actually lost money on your car and it doesn t benefit me to suggest you a new car , it benefits me if i repair it . well looks like it s both of us . . . because i did not get my money s worth and the money apparently went in to thin air since you didn t make money on my car . n nthe mechanic , jimmy , called me and suggested he offer me a steep discount . . which was he quote on quote . . . . and you have to get other things done too n n nyeah , no . i will say that jimmy offered me a ride to work and home for the duration my car was in the shop . i genuinely appreciate that service but unfortunately , my car is actually in worst shape and i basically feel like i just gave this company money and left with absolutely nothing . this is my first star review so you can imagine out of my reviews i ve done , how agitated it took for me to write this one and give them the worst rating . n n nstill annoyed every time i drive my car and realize what could have been if i just went with another company . . or just purchased a new car .

0,"i went into the grape with a friend ready to spend some dough and was talked out of it by circumstance and lack of choices . n nwe came in and jokingly asked for two glasses of milk to go with a bag of cookies that we happened to be carrying with us . right after that we asked to see the wine list and inquired if they had any good barolos . n nafter the barkeep try to bs his way through telling us that he knew what a barolo was , he went back and actually poured us two glasses of milk . n nwe took the mistake as a sign , opened our bag of cookies and enjoyed some milk and cookies , which i must say , was delicious . n nbartender mistake aside , i did spend a good amount of time looking at the wine menu which was uninteresting at best . the prices were not too bad , but there was just nothing interesting on the list and the place had a very stale vibe . n ni may stop in again for a second go around , but for now i gotta say that i ll be seeking my vino elsewhere .

0,"came here for dinner wednesday night . started off with bread and salad . the bread was warm and delicious , but the dipping oil was sour and horrible . the lettuce in both of our salads was old and tasted like fish . the tomatoes were also old and mushy . both the balsamic and creamy parmesan dressings were disgusting . there were not many meatless options on the menu , so i was stuck with the fried ravioli in marinara sauce , which i was not really in the mood for , but ended up being not too bad . my first impression was that the marinara tasted like jarred sauce , but it wasn t inedible . the side of garlic mashed potatoes was extremely bland and dry . my date enjoyed his seafood linguine in vodka sauce . we each got a glass of the red sangria , which really just tasted like a sweet red wine with a slice of orange and lime thrown in . we ended with mini cannolis , which were okay . overall not a very good dining experience , and i would never come back . "
0,"dined here last night . the food was probably three and a half to four star . we tried the filet mignon , which was cooked fine , and had a deliciously fresh flavor . the side of mashed potatoes was fine , but too much for one person . the she crab soup was excellent . n nthe service was simply atrocious . we had a reservation , and were seated within five minutes of our time . we arrived from out of town and were a few minutes late , but they accommodated nicely . however , once we got to the table our waitress just seemed to forget about us . it took thirty minutes just to get our order in . she kept disappearing for at least twenty minutes at a time , and as a result , we were still eating our dinner at pm . for the dessert , it took nearly twenty minutes at that late hour to go and find three plates of dessert ? ? ! she was polite and nice to us whenever she showed up , and we just didn t say anything . folks all around us had long been seated , served , and completed their meals in half the time it took us . nif you charge these kinds of prices , part of what you expect is good service . heck , any kind of service would have been nice . ndon t think we will come back unless we plan an entire day for a meal .

0,"well this used to be my place to refer anyone with a skin condition . they removed cancer years back on two adult family members and treated my own teenage acne issues years back . dr . thomas is very skilled and knowledgable but we booked with another dr . because it was a long wait for him and having dealt with a partner before without issue i thought this would be ok . went sour . no follow up , can t get dr to follow up on call , nurse called and couldn t answer questions on medication , other dr didn t want to step on toes to offer advice , another staff calls and asks to talk to patient instead of me and patient is a child , has no idea of where we are at with treatment because she says there are no notes of the last two conversations i ve had with the nurse about the prescription . my trust is blown . we will be seeking another dermatologist for this unresolved issue . "
0,"when i walked in to lucky strike , i immediately noticed the bar to my left . it was a very long bar with a ton of stools as well as a few tables . i almost liked the bar area more than the bowling area , because it was so roomy . the lanes , on the other hand , were pretty ridiculously crowded . n nfirst off , there weren t that many lanes . while there were also several pool tables in the building , the actual bowling area was pretty small , with only a dozen lanes . each lane had some couches and additional stool seating behind the lanes , but to get by everyone at your lane , you really had to wiggle around them because the couches were so close to the balls . it was incredibly awkward and forces you to get super close to the people you re with . n nalso , while there were some televisions broadcasting sports above the lanes , one of the screens simply scrolled through random pieces of art . i much rather would have watched music videos of the songs that were playing which were not good , by the way jamiroquai , seriously ? ! . the whole art thing was sort of bizarre to me and actually made the place seem less hip . n nthe crowd there , surprisingly , was mostly suits who probably came straight from work . i was surprised the place was as busy as it was . while our lane waitress was super friendly , service was really slow , and someone in our party said it almost would have made more sense just to walk to the bar ourselves for drinks . n nprices vary depending on times and days , but if you re going to bowl friday and saturday nights after p . m . , it ll cost a whopping . per lane per hour . that , to me , is ridiculous when so many other lanes have unlimited cosmic bowling with good music and music videos for only a person . don t go to lucky strike try scottsdale lanes instead .

0,"we ordered the sushi lunch special . for two rolls we got salmon and yellowtail a red dragon roll , and a soft shell crab , hot tea , miso soup , and a lemonade . the total was . . i would recommend the crab but not for the price . it was very small . the soup was just warm not hot but good . the tea was good and hot but they did not have any tea cups and they served it in saki cups . the salmon was good and the red dragon roll was good . the rice on all the sushi was very sticky and just slightly hard "
0,"ugh . we absolutely hated our experience here . when we first arrived , the host who was standing outside at a stand called us sir and madam , which i thought was a little peculiar but not in and of itself annoying . little did i know that minutes later , we d look back and think of his misplaced etiquette as the only positive thing about our dining experience at dragonfly . the service was totally unimpressive , especially given that the restaurant wasn t at all crowded , and the happy hour special long islands were more sour mix than alcohol , but what really turned us off was the overly sweet , sugary , and poorly thought out food . n nwe started with the mill avenue appetizer sampler . the only real standout was the cream cheese filled puffs ironically , the least authentic item the other items , including the sauce , were just off . the spare ribs were dry , the paper wrapped around the spring rolls was tough telltale sign that they hadn t been freshly made , and the sauces were watery and had no zest at all . we eagerly looked forward to our entrees but when they came and we tried them , we found ourselves wishing for the flavorless and subpar but not disgusting appetizers . my husband had the mango beef i used to work at a vietnamese fusion restaurant where this was featured on the menu , and there , it consisted of thinly sliced beef with tender pieces of mango and a oyster sauce . here , it was fatty chunks of beef with underripe mango in a sickeningly sweet , sticky sauce mixed up with a bunch of unrelated sauteed veggies . my yellow curry chicken and shrimp tasted less like a complex curry and more like a meat and veggie mixture think bad chinese tossed in a paper bag with a whole jar of curry powder . n nwhen the waiter came to clear our almost full plates , he asked if everything was ok . our philosophy is usually to say something in response to that question only if something is fixable e . g . , a meat can be redone to be less well done . in this case , the whole restaurant concept seems to be centered on serving flavorless and poor quality large portions to a university crowd they seem to think is un discerning . with so much wrong , a complete overhaul would be necessary . and , so . . . we said we re just full . thanks ! and got the hell out of there !

0,"we came with a party of and left after over an hour of waiting with reservations . the ma u eetre d was perhaps the most obnoxious person i ve ever experienced on this planet . even with the reservations , we were told that we could expect to wait about a half hour . when our buzzer rang minutes later that ma u eetre d angrily told us that it had only been minutes and that our signal had certainly not gone off or went off in error . n ni hang with a pretty yuppie crowd back home and i m typically prepared for dealing with the posh and pretentious crowd that frequents tao and places like it . what i was not prepared for was dining in a night club with staff that was even more pretentious than its already pretentious clientele and i fairly count myself amongst them . n ntone down the music and fire half the staff our cocktail waitress was great , and i think tao would be something special . as it stands , the ma u eetre d spoiled my dinner long before it had arrived . "
0,wouldn t know how it was cause we wouldn t wait an hour plus to get in . so we went to the bar directly across from marquee that had great music and a great bartender . we sure enjoyed drinking and dancing and watching the other fools stand in line for hours waiting to get into the coolest club ! 
0,"i am a graduate student and i ride cabs frequently to school and to work . out of all the cities i ve lived in yellow cab is the worst . it can take up to two hours to be picked up , and sometimes they never come at all . pittsburgh needs a new company to fulfill our cities needs . "
0,"i live just down the road from this place and go there for the convenience . the service is absolutely awful in the car wash area . they try to pressure you into adding add ons to your car wash and they don t take no for an answer very well as a matter of fact they can be out right rude . then there s the chipped windshield guys hovering around trying to pressure you into letting them fix a tiny nick in your windshield , and don t try to say no to these guys or you ll get more attitude from them . well today was the last straw for me , i pulled my car up to the vacuum spot and got out and stood there waiting , there were only two other cars there besides mine , and young the attendant waited on them first and when he was done with them he turned and walked a way , i waited a while longer to see what he was going to do and he never even acknowledged me so i walked inside and stood inside looking out to see what he would do , well they vacuumed my car out and ran it through the car wash so i got a hold of the manager and let him know what was going on and got an attitude from him . . . i ended up with a free car wash but i would rather have good service first and foremost and this was the second time this kind of service has happened to me here that s why i m boycotting cobblestone from here on out . enough is enough . join me in boycotting this place there are plenty of places close by to get a car wash and for that matter anything else this place sells . "
0,"literally not much more than a hole in the wall located in a neglected corner of chinatown this restaurant isn t a place to bring business partners , dates , or anybody you are hoping to impress . it s a dingy restaurant that s clearly seen better days and my iron stomach gets a little uneasy every time i step into the place . n nwhile the decor doesn t shine , the food does thanks to the thick sheen of oil on just about everything that comes out of the kitchen . it s typical canadian style chinese food and not a good version . n nthe one and only thing that is reasonably decent and even worth going back and risking food poisoning for is their selection of rice hot pots . it s a dangerously hot earthenware bowl of cooked rice that has a nice crispy crust on top , then they top it with a juicy stir fry , the sauces flow into and get absorbed by the rice . it s the perfect choice for a wintry montreal lunch and is one of the few chinese dishes where i bypass the chopsticks and head straight for the spoon . be warned , they take about minutes to cook , but i ve never seen them sold anywhere else in montreal .

0,just nasty my wife and i decided to give this place a try since they made the best of las vegas in the rj . the food was awful my wife ordered the beef tips and eggs and the beef tips needed a chain saw to cut through them . worst beef tips i have ever seen . as for the pancakes i ordered they were also tough not light and fluffy as a pancake should be and the banana i ordered with it must have been a half of a banana just pathetic . stay away much better options for breakfast in this town .

0,"tried this place because of a groupon . good thing it was at a discount , because it was not worth the money . n nwhile the location and building are very authentic and unique for the area , that is about all this place has going for it . n ni can t give a mexican restaurant a good review when they charge for chips and salsa , especially when the salsa is below average . n ni ordered the smoked chicken enchiladas and was disappointed . first the waitress messed up my order . i clearly said i wanted the beans and rice , this is a mexican restaurant , right ? for some reason my mexican food comes out with grilled seasonal vegetables and black beans . umm . . . ok . i didn t complain , bc i didn t want to wait any longer for my food . but this is definitely a first . overall , the enchiladas lacked flavor and the tortillas were hard . n ni will not return .

0,"i have gone to icon many times before and have always enjoyed the food and service . i am still trying to figure out if what happened last was actually real or just a bad dream . i walked in with a friend around pm for dinner , without reservations . after requesting a table for two , the hostess met us with a blank stare and said um . . . after what seemed like a painfully long time she reported they were full which we could see of course . we suggested she take our name to which she replied um . . . now this is where things turn from disappointing to outrageous . my friend states we will wait at the bar to which a male server also at the host stand replies , there are no seats at the bar , we could put a napkin on the floor for you . after outright asking them if they wanted our business , the response was a blank stare . we had no choice but to leave . . . and we will never return . customer service wouldn t even begin to cover it for these two shameful employees .

0,"very bad ! nnow people that know me , know that i love my meat ! i am very familiar with brazilian churrascaria s . i went there with a group of people on friday . four people in my group had never been to a place like this and i was sharing my past experiences and what might to expect . n nit was nothing like i explained to my friends . . . nwe got there and were seated . we were at a round table that was directly behind the hostess table and it was in the corner . there was a cement banister making it hard for two people to be comfortable and get in and out . n nthe waiter came by and was very pushy about getting the unlimited drinks . three of us ordered the unlimited and then we were told about the drink restrictions . whatever we went with it . n nhe didn t really explain about the process to the new people that were with us . i had asked him to explain and let them know the process . after the waiter being inconvenienced to explain the process , we were able to get up and go to the salad bar . mind you , the banister is there and just annoying . i will say that the sweet sour chicken was very good at the salad bar . n nfor the next minutes the only meats that were brought around was the pork loin , which was very good and moist and flavored well . the next was the house meat picanha , which was very bland and no flavor . the following was the lamb , i just don t do lamb . the last server had the pineapple ! besides the sweet sour chicken the pineapple was very good . that is all that came around . those same ones kept rotating for minutes . i finally went up to talk to the manager and asked how many meats are in rotation . she told me there are . i let her know the situation and she said she will look into it . n nsoon after that a female server came directly at me and again had the lamb , i said no thank you , the same server came out and then had the picanha and i didn t like it the first times so i said no . she then said . well , what meats do you want ? i was like whoa ! excuse me , she again said which meats do i want . i said i do not know all the meats you have and then she , in a sarcastic latina voice started to ramble and ramble the meat list . i had to ask her to stop and i could not understand her ramblings and again she said the names and faster . i then said , why are you just asking me ? there are other people at this table but we all have only chosen from different items . she was irritated and i was too . then the male bald server came directly to me again and he brought the lamb . really ? i said to him , is that al they have back there because we had not had any sausage , chicken , tri tip , other meats . i was really disappointed that apparently the manager pointed me out and i felt these servers were overdoing it and still not bringing anything other than the ones we already had . n neventually they brought out the sausage and chicken , but by this time i was really irritated and they never brought all choices . smh . . . i will not be going back to this place .

0,"though a bit longer of a drive than we normally make for lunch , our office lunch crew wanted something different , so we decided to try and find a cuban place and came across this one which got us all excited . n nwhen we arrived , we were unimpressed by the exterior , but figured plenty of dives have awesome food . n nwe were seated fairly quickly in some beautiful . . . lawn chairs ? ! the chairs were the cheap plastic chairs you use when you havee guests in your backyard and don t give a crap about their comfort . the atmosphere was tacky and unimpressive . n ni ordered a chicken sandwich special as i didn t see any torta one the menu what respectable cuban place doesn t have a simple torta on their menu ? ! . the sandwhich was dry and flavorless and tasted as if it received no seasoning at all . my companions all looked at their food after tasting it and were disappointed as well . n nreceiving a refill on a water was like asking the government to stop spending money , it just wasn t going to happen . n nhorrible experience , bland food , overpriced . in short , never going back and don t recommend it to anyone .

0,"this place is a disaster . avoid it at all costs for the following reasons n n they lied about the price . we called and asked for the price multiple times and were told per person all day . when we arrived . . . the price had magically jumped to per person . n n the servers are racist . they will not give you good service unless you are korean . this applies to other asians as well that they look down upon chinese , vietnamese , filipino , etc . and if you re african american or hispanic ? forget about it . they will pretend not to see you when you try to call them multiple times and walk right past you . this leads into . . . n n the servers will do their best to deny you meat refills . they will take as long as possible to bring your order to save money . slow service means they lose less meat and less money so they ll snail it as much as possible . expect minute waits per plate . n nfinally , and most importantly . . . n n . the waitress poured steaming hot water on my mother s hand . a flippant sorry and they were gone . n nif the above sounds like an enjoyable time and a great way to spend your hard earned money then by all means , come to woonam jung , where you will be ignored , ripped off , and doused with boiling water .

0,"parking there is a pain in the ass . the ever popular mpd wasted no time in ticketing cars parked around the corner . the signs read , no parking between pm and am hrm , seems be aimed directly at the bar business . wtf . perhaps the obnoxious , money grubbing city of madison could consider issuing warnings first , or make the tickets a nominal fine , like bucks . oh , we can t do that and still fund the liberal bike boxes , can we ? or buy snow making machines . so instead of wisely spending money , they ll sock it to people out and about . way to go madison . n nthe bar itself is fine , plenty of room , except , the bathrooms they should put in more ! there were girls in the men s bathroom waiting to use the stall .

0,"bottom line rapid collision center . performed work to vehicle without prior approval . lied about receiving approval from my insurance company for the additional work . failed to communicate needed information to me in a timely manner . failed to communicate with adjuster about additional repairs in a timely manner . poor work done n ni brought my vehicle to rapid collision center for repairs from a front end collision . they properly had an adjuster from my insurance company come out and approve certain repairs to my vehicle . while they were preforming the work , they discovered additional repairs would be needed and decided to preform the additional repairs without having prior approval from the adjuster . i hadn t heard from them by the date they originally told me my vehicle would be ready , so i called to find out how things were going . this is when they told me that they needed to complete more work and would need additional time . a few more days pass with no communication from them . i again call them to find out what is taking so long and i am informed that my vehicle has been completely repaired , but they are waiting for the additional work that they had already done to be approved by the insurance company . i called my adjuster at this point to see how long it would take to get approval . my adjuster informed me that he hadn t even heard from rapid collision center about any additional needed repairs ! ! i called rapid collision center back immediately and they said that they were about to contact him . a few more days pass and i call again to find out if the repairs have been approved yet , at which point nate tells me that yes , the insurance company has approved the repairs . he suggested that i come in and pay for the additional repairs and have my insurance company pay me back instead of them since the repairs had been approved . this was a lie ! my insurance company had only approved part of the additional cost , not the total . i called as soon as i found this out , and they apologized and told me that they would be glad to refund me the difference if my insurance company didn t reimburse me after they submit it to them again . well , they submitted it again and again , and they were denied again and again . i sent a letter requesting the promised refund no response . it doesn t rain very often in arizona , but when the next large rain storm came through water leaked in and completely soaked the passenger side of the vehicle . at this point there was no way i would go back to rapid collision center to address their poor workmanship . i found a different repair shop down the street and explained my dilemma to them . the man took a look at my vehicle , told me what he thought the problem was , and fixed it for me . he charged me for parts only ! please , please , please , do not use rapid collision center ! when i was speaking to my adjuster he even told me that this company was one of the worst he has ever had to deal with !

0,"food is what i d expect from a diner , but the service is horrid . price value good"
0,"i have been to this store many times before . i have spent a lot of money over time . the service was good to ok most of the time . the store is a bit too busy and too packed with stuff . the prices are on the high side . the sales ladies are very pushy . n nthe reason why i m giving stars they announced a treasure hunt for kids from on a thursday for their opening night . no other details . i get my kids excited as the prize could be a tub full of toys . since the drawing would be at i thought i would come in at so we have time to wait and see who won the tub . i call in at to just double check the address as i was already driving for minutes and would be there before . they tell me they were closing up shop and had already drawn a winner . i had to turn around tell my kids the store closed and drive back minutes . n nthey told me this was meant to be a minute treasure hunt . who makes a minute treasure hunt for kids ? the lady on the phone was ok . the owner was right there next to her as i could hear her instructions saying come back over the weekend and we will have more prizes . i m already out with kids , minutes away and they tell me to come back ? ? no regards for their clients . very sad with this experience . imagine that i was just trying to time right so my kids didn t go crazy waiting in the store for the drawing . n njust be aware that they just may close shop on you !

0,"my wine was served in a dirty glass , one of the bartenders had a mouth like a sailor f bombs , listened to a server give a couple a hard time over whether or not they ordered fries or slaw . overall a weird atmosphere . . . save your money ! ! "
0,i set an appointment and they forgot about me . sucks to wait and get blown off . no call . . . nothing . 
0,"ice was choppy even after zamboni . no attendant on ice to referee reckless skaters or monitor bad falls . kids coming out on ice in their tennis shoes . no rubber mats out , so if you brought your own skates you d mess up the skating edge by walking on concrete . employees seemed to be more into visiting with regulars . session started minutes late . i miss the ice rink at metrocenter !

0,"warning ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! do not use this company . they are actually posing as the real pool masters , who i thought i was calling . this company has been investigated by the police , which i found out later . after a week of service , my pool became greener than my grass and on service day the hacks showed up and threw a bunch of chlorine tabs in my pool and left . they didn t vaccum , scrub , clean the filter or do anything else . this review is for the pool masters on lake mead . they are the fake ones . since i have aquired the real pool masters i have to say they are the best pool company i have ever used . i hope this review finds someone before they are tricked like i was . "
0,"ok so the decor inside is interesting and worth a look maybe even sit around and have a drink and look at the cheesy art copies on the wall but that s it . they are a late night place that attracts the looser art crowd of vegas mixed with some white trash for good measure . parking is a nightmare , they have very few spots . i got dragged to this hidden hell hole on a late saturday night and it was about half full with two rooms of people , one more of a lounge and the other more of a club and bar with a small dance floor and terrible music . no one was dancing and they would have been better off just putting it on the local top radio station . my hats off to the waitresses though they were very courteous and fun . "
0,"okay so based on the food . . . nope . the service was awesome . . i walked in around or so and the workers jumped up . im pretty simple and asked what their best sandwich was . it was a georgetown they said . alright good enough for me . then i got the sandwich and started looking at it . . . well it was so skimpy on the meat i was confused as hell . . it looked like oz of meat . . literally one piece of turkey and pieces of bacon . . i understand it was a small . . but still for bucks i think it should fill me up . it was more bread than meat . . i worked at a few sandwich places before and all load em up better than here . . i recommend firehouse subs . may pay a more or so , but when you get x the meat its so much more worth it . "
0,"i hope this restaurant doesn t go out of business soon . it took forever for the food to arrive that we ended up asking for it to go . also , while the staff was in the kitchen , we saw customers come in , wait to be seated , and leave since there was not a proper host hostess position . the portions are ridiculously small and not filling in the least bit . overpriced , bad service , absolutely no one in the restaurant during lunch hour on a sunday besides the other party sitting outside . n nanother bone to pick , they list out all the soups on their menu and do not specify that they only have one soup of the day . bleh . save your pretty pennies for a real organic cafe . "
0,"most workers seemed friendly but i got the one guy with a bad attitude . he gave me a very hard time about returning an item that was within the guidelines of the return policy . he gave me lots of attitude and i remained polite through the whole experience . when he gave me my money back he literally slapped it into my hands with the coins scattering onto the counter and stormed off . i realize this is probably just his day job while his recording career is taking off sarcasm , but there is no excuse for the attitude . the return item was around and we would have spent over on road cases that we saw while we were there , but after that experience , i refuse to shop there . protip for sam ash if you re going to refund someone s money , be friendly about it and keep their business . heads up to shoppers , most items fall under their restocking fee policy , "
0,"a group of friends and i had come here after a night of heavy drinking . we used to come here all the time when it was supermex . i guess the chef also changed along with the name change , because the food was pretty bad that night . when we first arrived , we sat in the section right next to the bar . it took us minutes to get our waters when there was no one else in the restaurant . the ten minutes seemed like forever since we were all pretty slizzard . when we ordered our food , the waitress seemed alright . my boyfriend wanted to get guacamole instead of refried beans . the waitress kept saying that it wasn t possible and they can t do that . so my boyfriend tried telling her he ll pay extra if you can just give us the guacamole on the side instead of the beans , but she still said no . but wait . . . when we wanted an extra side of guac later after we had gotten our food , it was ok ? ok . whatever . after ordering , it literally took minutes to get our food . there was no one else in the restaurant , just us , and it took so stinkin long . when we finally did get our food , anyone who had ordered carne asada style ended up with really tough burnt meat . the food and service was all around bad . this really saddened my good friend because hes been coming here since forever and now we have to find somewhere else to go "
0,so i haven t had wendy s in years . . had their lunch value menu double patty cheeseburger . . ok i m not going to say it didn t taste ok but it was dripping greasy . . made my stomach sick . . also no lines and you still have to wait for your meal . . took long . . 
0,"overpriced and bland . i got the orange custard and the lemon custard , both recommended by the cashier . they all tasted like regular eggy custard . if i closed my eyes i wouldn t be able to tell them apart . it s also incredibly overpriced at something for a small scoop or dip , as they call it . the only flavor that seems to be good here is the chocolate . otherwise , save your money and your time and just go somewhere else . star because it s a campus novelty , and apparently you haven t gone to u of i until you ve been to jarlings .

0,"we have a regular go to when it comes to breakfast but had heard good reviews about biscuits on gilbert road . after several attempts to coax my daughter into trying something new we decided on biscuits for brunch this morning . wow , what a mistake . not only were my biscuits , which i think that s what they re known for by their name , so stale and hard that i could not even cut them , my daughter found a long twisted hair throughout her food . needless to say we were both utterly disgusted and the waitress contacted the manager on our behalf . he basically just said this has never happened before and i m very sorry . i find it very hard to believe that we were singled out for this bad service . we left without eating and on our way out our waitress came up to me and told me that she was embarrassed about the whole situation . it certainly was not her fault , definitely a management issue . i cannot understand the good reviews as our first and only experience was horrible . needless to say we will never go there again and i am definitely going to pass this on . "
0,"i need to preface first by saying that i have always looked forward to an evening at az . it was the first cool restaurant i ever visited before moving to phoenix . nlast night , however , was an extremely disappointing experience . my party of arrived at pm for drinks and dinner . drinks took a very long time to arrive to the table , and we finally ordered food at pm . as we sat with empty drinks every single person in the party , we noticed all tables around us , which had arrived after us , getting food . we finally said something to our server at about pm . drinks are still empty at this point . when our food arrived minutes later almost an hour wait , without new drinks , of course , fries and sandwiches were cold . we were told the manager was going to fix things whatever that meant , and come check in with us . manager never came . nothing was ever fixed , except for plates of hot fries . we were offered free dessert , but by that point we didn t feel like risking additional wait . nbeing a server in the past myself , i understand issues happen , especially on a friday night . it was disappointing though to see that no true or genuine effort was taken to fix the experience on part of the manager . it was the first time i felt insulted to even expect to leave a tip considering the bill and disappointing experience . my apologies to the server , but i could only leave . perhaps you can ask your manager for the remaining i would . of the time leave a server . "
0,"a lot has already been said about the food here , and i don t think i have much more to add . however , in my opinon delux makes a huge mistake . . . since when was it cool to take away everyone s privacy ? i went here with a client , and was almost afraid to say anything confidential because the next patrons over were only about inches from my face ! ok , they weren t that close but it felt like it . at one point the woman next to me actually chimed in on a comment i made to my client about the drink i was having ! n ni think it s arrogant for delux to think their food is so good that everyone will gladly sit on each other s laps in order to wolf down a marginally creative burger . n nthe bottom line is that you shouldn t come here if you want one shred of privacy to talk with your companions . if you re alone however , this might be the perfect place to make some friends !

0,"i have never wrote a review before . everywhere i go i understand people make mistakes sometimes so i forgive and forget . but every time i go to this mcdonalds they always forget something in my order so i have to go back or they get my order wrong . and when i say always i mean always ! there hasn t been a time where i came here and i get what o asked for . i also understand that probably no one likes working at fast food places , but you don t have to show it to the customers . be professional , these people always seem bothered .

0,"this place is less than honest . we turned up on a saturday evening at pm , we were the only customer , afterwards , there were three more when we left . we ordered the dish meat lover for the hungry at . , which was supposed to include prime rib eye , kobe chuck and kobe rib eye . to our surprise , a waiter came up silently with a plate that has one row of meat undistinguished of any kind , kobe or not , it all looks alike . next , it was worse when we tasted it , it was less than fresh , and for a hungry meat lover , it was a real bad experience that mad us run away . we then tried to stop by monday at lunch time , to make our complaint , the manager duly took note and said he would review the camera in the kitchen and contact us , alas , we never heard of him again , so we assumed the the camera did not lie ! ! ! !

0,"the last time we were here was about ten years ago and we loved it back then so thought we would give it a try again . n nlet s see , rio buffet how do i hate you , let me count the ways . n nyes , there is a huge selection and is a great place for those with larger groups and different tastes . but , it really ends there . n ni think the line system really sucks . we had a coupon and had to stand in line to the right , while people who were way behind us went up to the credit card side , paid and got seated way before we did . if i had to guess , we had to wait an extra minutes to be seated from those people who were at the back of the line . i don t know how they think this is fair but i guess this is their attempt to keep the line moving . n nwhen we were standing in line , we could see a bunch of empty tables that weren t being cleaned . the line wasn t that long for a saturday night but the wait was over minutes . even when we got inside , there were empty tables and still a ton of people in line . n nour server was just ok , he did bring drinks relatively quickly but when it came to taking our dirty plates away , he was very slow . n nwe really enjoy sushi and the selection here was pathetic and tasted gross . the rice was kind of crunchy , and not really fresh . the chicken i had was very dry and there were a few other things that i tried but didn t finish because they were just not good at all . n none thing that was very good was the gelato , and the meat station had a decent and pretty tasty selection . i did have what sort of looked like creme brulee but it was not c . b . i don t know what it was , but the bottom of it was all liquidy and raw ! yuck ! n noverall , i think you can do much better somewhere else . i know some people really enjoy this buffet but my husband and i did not . yes , there is alot of quantity , but i think the quality for the most part was really lacking .

0,any place that does not allow headwear like caps or hats in my mind is segregating out people who have to wear that for whatever reason like religion or for covering up some disfigurement . i knwo several friends that fall under this category . if they are barred from this establishment then i too do not care to patronize it . 
0,"i have found that customer service is not important to the ashley furniture at s martin luther king blvd and they showed very little empathy . on dec th i purchased a two piece sectional and a queen size bed totaling and picked out another worth of furniture for purchase in january . on dec rd i picked up the two sectional pieces from the warehouse behind the store with my pickup truck . the guy loaded it and when i asked if it would go anywhere or if i needed to tie it down he said , no . it is tight and not going anywhere . this sounded pretty confident to me and if he had said it could move and fall out i would have picked up each piece separately . guess what . . . driving down the south at just mph the chaise portion fell out of the truck over the side . thankfully it didn t hit any cars and no one hit it , but the highway patrol had to push it to the side of the road and we put it back into the truck . the chaise is well built and was in one piece but the faux leather on one side and the arm were torn up . this wouldn t of happened if the warehouse worker hadn t loaded it top heavy . but he had assured that it was in the bed of the truck tight and wasn t going anywhere . on monday after christmas i emailed the customer service manager and got the usual canned response that it isn t there responsibility and they would sell me a new one for . small discount . i then asked them to take of the blame since this happened because of their employee . i was willing to take of the blame . i asked for a discount on a new chaise section since it was their fault . the ticket price of the chaise was or if you divide the price of the sectional in half . so i was asking for a new chaise between to . ashley said that they would take no blame based on the contract and the best discount would be . as a grade student at unlv who just moved here from la and bought a new house every dollar is important . i don t think i am asking for too much . it is obvious that they don t care about creating a long term happy customer who was planning to spend another next month and another over the next year to furnish my new house . i was planning to spend this money with ashley furniture . i guess i will take it elsewhere since there are many choices to purchase furniture . all i am asking for is responsibility and a discount to go with it . on a good note peter lau my sales person was good but he won t be getting anymore of my business because of their customer service manager . i could have easily been made happy in this situation .

0,"upon the purchase of a burberry trench coat worth , i took the time to search for a reputable dry cleaner . four seasons was expensive , but their claim was that they specialized in high end dry cleaning , even noting several top names , including burberry . n nwith a staff person , we went over where there were a few ink stains the coat was a consignment find , and all buttons , openings , flaps , etc . the bill came to , and i was charged for each individual belt and the jacket lining separately . n ni returned to pick up the coat , and one of the prominent front buttons was cracked and half missing . waiting for an explanation as to what we both saw , i received none . when i asked as to why the button was cracked , i was directed to a small sign stating that they wern t responsible for missing or cracked buttons . i argued that we d gone over the coat together , nothing was cracked or missing initially , that it was caused in the process . again i was directed to the small sign , this time i was offered that they could repair the button by using a extra button on the jacket that was hidden but they didn t offer to fix their own mistake for free . infuriated , i left . n nin summary , four seasons does not stand by their work , nor do they take responsibility for their mistakes . they are not a high quality dry cleaners , merely an elegant storefront . take your business to a local dry cleaners that does a better job the one i found is the new oakland tailor on meyran ave in oakland .

0,"no flavor at all ! i should have gotten sharp cheddar instead of going along with the provolone on the white trash burger . the meat was dry as well . i liked the waffle fries with pimento cheese but my girlfriend didn t . oh yeah , the crab puppies hush puppies with crab had a minimalist amount of crab in them . it was basically all dough . servers were friendly attentive but we seemed to have of them they kept asking us if we were ok . all in all , we probably aren t coming back . not enough flavor , sorry .

0,"i was not impressed at all with this place . to be completely honest , i went to robertos right after to get more food . to start the meal was overpriced . the portion size was much smaller than cafe rio or roberto s and the quality was not even close . the pork was dry and the tortillas were not very good . they also did not have dessert when i was there . why have it on the menu ? just a tease ! i will not be returning !

0,"i paid dollars for a lemon meringue pie . it looked great ! we went to serve it and the lemon filling inside spilled out everywhere like milk . whoa ! we tasted it , and the flavor was really good , but no one was expecting a watery pie with meringue on top for bucks . yikes ! n nof course , if no one was worried about the appearances at all , we could have just used a straw to slurp up all the runny insides .

0,"they ll take your money but only if you re in the finest of dress apparently . can t believe a place that claims to be based on the blues would reject people for a guy wearing a nice pair of new levi s , timberland shoes and an nfl logo coach s sideline polo . she was wearing a nice blouse and jeans as well . when they wouldn t even suggest we bother going to the elevator from the shop where you get your tickets , we wondered why our money wasn t as good as anyone elses . she literally told us we wouldn t be accepted as we weren t wearing formal attire . really ? for the blues ? and on top of this on a hotel comp ? then the server has the audacity to ask us if we d like to dine in the restaurant instead . seriously ? so we went to the strip steak house , dressed as is , and dropped on dinner there instead . n nthe dumbass server didn t even get the irony of refusing us service while standing in front of the sign talking about not being able to pay the rent , getting dumped , losing a job . n nenjoy your tour of the blues , if you re good enough . n nsigned , n nthe guy that shopped at the same old pepper tree market on laurel and safeway on san carlos avenue as john lee hooker when i was a kid . i d love to have him back to join me on a trip to this pretentious piece of shit that supposedly honors his legacy .

0,"almost walked out of the place . having spent years working in the restaurant industry , i have learned that there s a good correlation to condition of the bathrooms and the overall hygiene in the kitchen . while some places can slip on hygiene provided they deep fry everything and serve it hot , sushi cannot . poor hygiene leads to an unhappy digestive system . n nhad i not already ordered my food , i would have left after using the restrooms . n ni stumbled in here by accident and i would be happy to not try it again . n noverall the quality and flavor of the sushi was about as good as a supermarket . it was not bad , per se . but , it certainly was not good . i would not recommend ishi for sushi . n nthe atmosphere gets a out of . n nservice gets a out of . n ni recommend a pass when you are in the mood for sushi .

0,"sad to say i wasn t impressed with this place . we received a postcard coupon in the mail and while i don t usually fall for those , i was going to be near there anyway , so why not try it ? n ni was originally headed for the mexican restaurant next door , but they weren t open yet and i only had limited time , so i went here and had the club sandwich , which was really disappointing . the meat was really gamey tasting like it had been on the frig shelf a few days too long and the basket of fries was cold by the time we got it . n nbecause of the coupon , it was a cheap meal . . . so i shouldn t complain , i guess . but i can t say i d go back . . . practically free or not .

0,"my fiance and i just moved here from so cal and had a mexican food craving . i searched el picante on yelp and read to the reviews . i thought for sure this place was going to hit the spot . i thought wrong . big time . this place gives mexican food a bad name . we could have had a more authentic meal at del taco . first off the food is not fresh . i ordered one chicken and one beef taco . while the white man i guess the owner started making mine , my fiance peeked in the back of the kitchen and noticed bags of meat . after we were unable to hear the cleaver and the knifes cutting up the meat in the back or no meat on a skillet or bbq , he told us there is a new batch of beef coming up . we looked at the meat and was horrified . it was all packaged pre seasoned meat . this meat wasn t even touched by this restaurant . came right out of a bag into the tray . probably from cisco or costco . very shameful to call them selves a mexican restaurant ! even worse the two chefs in the kitchen were latino and serving this stuff ! what would their parents or grand parents think . i think the owner needs to toss the packaged ingredients and take a trip to so cal and see how its really done . places like this give mexican food such a bad influence . i will keep looking for a real authentic mexican restaurant !

0,"this is a mixed review and it was hard to decide how many stars to give this place . i play here often enough that one would assume that i like it a lot . not always the case . i do track my play and i am up at this room , i walk away a winner more often than not . it is a young , hip , touristy room and because of that the competition is fairly week . solid players should not have a problem turning a profit in this room as the games tend to be soft . n nthe cocktail service is always good . the waitress comes around often and i never have to wait very long to get my order . they don t offer any draft , just the standard selection of bottles one would expect to find at a casino . n nthat being said , this room is typically not well ran and some of dealers really have no business working here or in any other poker room for that matter . i hate to put him on blast , but wow , al is the slowest dealer ever . seriously , ever . he cannot keep the game going , he cannot multi task and if there is any kind of distraction , cocktail waitress , football game or god forbid , someone actually trying to have a conversation with him , forget about it . you might as well use the minutes when he is at the table to stretch your legs and take a bathroom break . you might get or hands dealt in minutes if you are lucky . n nthere are a few really good dealers here but they change tables every half hour . so during a hour session i m lucky if out of the dealers that work my table are among those select few . also , this is not really a poker room but rather a group of tables surrounded with some velvet rope smack in the middle of the casino . which amounts to one thing an abundance of cigarette smoke . players , spectators and people just passing by can smoke less than a foot from where i m playing . i try to sit toward the middle of the room whenever possible . it doesn t really matter though , i still breath it and smell like an ashtray when i leave . n nafter writing this review i m actually not sure why i even patronize this place . ahhh the things i do for good ev .

0,"this place is pretty basic eating for your casino cafe dining . i prefer this to the coco s across the street at texas station only because at least here i know i won t be ignored . the staff is usually friendly and you can see that they try really hard to make the most of your meal , even if you order off the menu . i never feel like they judge me even when i order like a real cheepo . n nthe last time i went in , i ordered something and all was fine until the server said they no longer had that item . okay , i order something else heavily modified because the lack of ingredients . again a few minutes later she comes back and says they were also out of that . it was a holiday themed meal , it s the holiday season , so now i m a little miffed . so i order the same thing as what my husband has ordered , not really knowing what s in it , only knowing it has turkey and that s what i want . n nthe food comes out in little spurts because now the cook is really confused , so says the server . we split the first sandwich and by the time the second comes i m done . it was just too greasy for me . later on after waiting a while for the check we just get up to pay seeing if they could print out the check up front . they were able to but it was wrong , still having what i had first ordered on it . the hostess begins to fix it and at this time the server comes up and they proceed to get into an argument about it because of the mix up the server doesn t want to charge me at all and the hostess is just not going to let that fly . n n i didn t care either way , it was nice of the server to try , but it wasn t like i was completely void of a meal . still eighteen dollars for two sandwiches seems steep for me especially at denny s no less . it s okay , this trip was a little off , but i ve had better here before so i will probably be back .

0,"i have heard so many good reviews for this place , so who wouldn t try it ? i should have taken the hints before i got my meal , that this wasn t a good choice . n nhint location it s right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park . n nhint food test it was nice that i got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn t up to par , the guy wouldn t leave me alone about sampling . n nhint decor i know this should never have anything to do with the food , but it felt like i was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town , wobbly chairs , wobbly table . n ni ordered the teriyaki chicken didn t think it would be bad , i mean who can mess up teriyaki ? with chicken fried rice once again , how on earth can you mess up fried rice ? n nthe chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day . such a horrible taste . the fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out , kind of had a gross tangy after taste . there also wasn t any spices or egg in the fried rice , just a bunch of green onion , which technically isn t a fried rice . this meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store . n nthey also give you a snickerdoodle cookie , that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu , until i noticed it wasn t cooked all the way through . n nbut the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair i found floating in my teriyaki sauce . n nso the expensive meal was so not worth it , and i m sure when diners drive ins and dives visited , the food was great , but today it was the grossest thing i ve ever had .

0,"my boyfriend and i were sooo unimpressed . the service was not top notch and it was overpriced as many others have said , but that is not the reason for the bad review . the food simply was not good . the paella was completely unauthentic . it seemed like there was some sort of pre made rice mix they used with shriveled peas and they just threw some seafood or meat in there . we took a couple of bites and couldn t bring ourselves to eat any more . my boyfriend even threw up after we got home . we were so excited that there was an authentic spanish restaurant in arizona , but it was far from authentic . on the plus side , the tapas were better than the paella . i think that the best part of the meal by far was the bread with some sort of garlic aioli dip . so , if you go here , stick with the bread and tapas and stay away from the main dishes .

0,they just plain and simply have the worst customer service . the manager needs to take a class in guest services ! ! i find it sad because i love albertsons . the employees try to do what they can for the guest understanding the guest but the managers hold them back ! 
0,"wasn t happy with the service . . . . . or lack of . it wasn t everyone thank you to young lady that asked if i wanted anything and the one who apologized , but one specific server who made the experience negative . in the area visiting but i know i won t go back to this location . "
0,went there for the thanksgiving dinner . what a mistake ! dry turkey with horrible tasting green beans . also ordered mojitos and they were the worse i ve had . i do not know about the rest of the menu but the thanksgiving dinner was overpriced and gross . the two stars are for the dinner roles and the parmesan chips . 
0,"pretty much the same impression as the other reviewers . . . it s ok but expensive for what you get . i had the bulgogi sushi which was made to order , so it was better than what you d pull out of a refridgerator case . but for . you only got a little bit of beef and if there were cucumber and avocado in there , it was hard to tell . i will say that the kimchi was fresh as was the seaweed salad sides that i bought . i guess i might go back if it were pay day because i don t like waiting in line at penn ave fish company .

0,"take this place off my list ! first of all , they are very disorganized , no system at all . a coworker likes going to this place so another coworker and i decided to try it . what a disappointment . . for a lunch special of drink , salad and slice of pizza . not worth it ! after placing our order , we paid , no one told us what to do next , we stood around looking lost , then a server comes out with our salad , we told her where we wanted to sit . we started eating our salad , and again , lost . . . where is our pizza ? so i go back to the counter and one of the guys behind the counter asked what i was waiting for , and i said the cheese pizza that comes with the special . no one had gotten the pizza ready so he gets a slice of cheese pizza , i told him two please , he sticks it in the oven to warm it up . again , i am standing not know what to do or what is going on . after minutes , i asked how long it will take to warm up the pizza , he says it s ready , takes it out , puts it in this cheap thin paper plate and hands it to me and i had to almost run to my table as the pizza was hot and i didn t want to burn myself . . . eeeks ! the salad is packaged , pizza too cheesy and soggy . nope , this place is totally off my list . . .

0,"uh . . . . no . if i want to blaze up with the hookah this might be the joint pardon the expression . if i want to shoot pool ? no way in hell i will be back to this place . i use to work at a failing pool hall in seattle and i see much of the same here . . . . no booze . cool , but that always means over priced table time . . no a c uh . . . . really , you think i will be back and invite my friends to sweat it out at degs in your boring over priced smokey pool hall ? . . . . your are smokin the hope iam my friends . times are tough , i get it , but the winners are not who offers less , but who offers more . . . . you , i am sad to say lose in an epic way .

0,"too early to write a review ? perhaps i will have a change of heart after the grand opening but i m not holding my breath . n ni ve really tried to embrace downtown phoenix as an urban area but it has truly been difficult . n nif cityscape just had one tall highrise floors , it would have given it such a different feel . or something that would have given phoenix a landmark that signifies that it s truly a city . this was phoenix s chance to really be known as the th largest urban city however , it just continues to be a spread of suburbia . the same chain restaurants and retail shops i . e . cvs , pf changs , aj s , five guys burger , etc . and high end boutiques that are supposedly going to be opening in cityscape . . . aren t we getting bored of this ? in fact , cityscape reminded me of cherry creek area in denver . . . nice development and appropriately situated in the suburbs . cherry creek did not make it as their downtown , so why are we ? n ni wished cityscape would have been a downtown area that could have shown off phoenix in a new light of excitement , diversity , uniqueness , and character . maybe someday , but not through cityscape .

0,"i must apologize for my harshness however , our overall experience was worthy of a critical review . n . our server recommended the most popular dish , the green curry , he said it was also the staff favorite it turned out to be the most flavorless curry i d ever tasted in my life ! my previous reviews clearly reflect a developed taste for indian , thai , and japanese curries this was by far the most flavorless and least impressive curry if i dare call it curry . the chicken was chewy , as in cheap quality and or a fast boil and flavorless . . . wasn t cooked in a tandoori , that s for sure . n . my falafel were small and burnt to a crisp however flavorful . the spanakopita that my wife ordered tasted like flavorless eggs how can feta cheese and spinach taste bland ? n . how does a restaurant with so many reviews and such high ratings manage to serve food like this ? you can tell that there was no love or time put into our dishes the chicken tasted like it was prepared minutes before chewy as hell , the curry sat under the heat lamps the surface of the curry sauce was wrinkled and dry and was insanely flavorless , and my dolmas were loaded with a dry type of meat , no rice , and largely tasted like grape leaves . n n environment on dining side was okay . i feel like the owners were trying to hard to decorate the interior like something vaguely resembling a mediterranean restaurant . n price totally isn t worth it . i would be more comfortable buying some good store bought hummus , pita , and a roasted chicken for . whole foods . n n n we aren t coming back here .

0,worst pho i ever had . the meats were frozen . in fact it was so frozen that it stillnjad frost on them . not to mention that i wanted to dine in and they bagged everything to go . who doest that ? 
0,"i give it one star for their customer service . . . n ni went to this restaurant on their opening day after reading an article n n pancheros mexican grill , a fast casual mexican restaurant , is opening jan . in chandler , and they ll sell burritos to mark the occasion . n nburritos will be available for a buck a week later , p . m . to p . m . feb . at w . chandler blvd . , suite . n nafter being told to come back feb . th i showed the employee the article and she said no it was written wrong . i drove over minutes to get here i told her and asked for the manager , she said he was busy . . . really ? too busy to talk to an happy customer ? n ni am not unreasonable after i left i can see their ad was poorly written and easily misunderstood . i would expect a manager to come out and speak with me and explain what happened in the least or act like they care about their customers . n ni don t like to give one stars but in the few cases that i have it is usually for bad service . i would have paid full price for their burrito , but after the way they handled the situation i have no choice .

0,"this used to be one of my favorite mexican restaurants in vegas . and i m not coming back for a long time . nmy last experience was baaad . not only the food was less than good , the service was horrible . n nthe guacamole tasted ok , the ceviche was fishy and too sour . we ordered margaritas and a mojito . one of the margaritas wasn t good so my friend returned it . nthe waitress was slow and never around . we asked her for more chips and she just literally dropped the new basket into the old empty one , also , nobody was clearing the table from dirty plates , when the food runner came to drop our entrees he left me holding the dirty plates ! he looked at me holding them with no more room on the table to put them down and just walked away ! nat the end of our dinner we asked to talk to a manager , so this woman manager comes to our table not being very nice , we told her about everything that happened and she just said , ok i ll talk to my staff , thank you . well now you see why i m probably never coming back . management sucks ! and food is not the same anymore , very disappointed .

0,just leaving the good egg after being ignored by everyone in the store after being seated at counter . this a trend that seems to be getting worse with time . the servers seem detached and oblivious to the customers . there has been a high turnover at this store i noticed lately . new faces every weekend . after years i think it is time to find a new fav breakfast place . 
0,"way , way overpriced . often the glassware in the cases is knocked over , and just lying there , with a price tag . some of the wall art is broken , too . i noticed one of the rooms is now emptied out . not sure about the clothing selection , it looks like it s worth digging through . you will have to dig , too , because the shop is packed .

0,"not impressed at all . this is the rd place we have used to board our dog . they seemed to treat him more like a number . we used pete and mac s our last visit and they were much better . they didn t do anything wrong just felt like the walmart of pet hotels . no followup call , no detail in the report , and very transaction interaction at check in and out . ranks rd out of the we have used .

0,"my boyrfriend and i came on monday , april . although i may be the first on here to give them a one star , i have my reasons . i had high expectations prior to dinning here , but after our experience . . it was a total disappointment . n ni was overwhelmed with the menu , and the servers didnt bother helping us . since foie gras wasnt on the menu other than on the tasting menu , that s what we both decided to go with , the course tasting menu . n nit started off great , as our first dish , we had the caviar surprise mixed with different crabs . everything went down hill there and on . . so disappointing ? ! our lobster was over poached . . . mind you , we have lobster at home pretty often , so u cant fool us p the chef should know how to poach lobster to it s perfection if we can ! my boyfriend and i love love love foie gras , but guess what ? they over cooked it . i must say the worst dish we had was the asparagus dish , that thing tasted like chinese herbal medicine . eeh hella gross . . . n ni think by the th dish , i literally stopped eating , i really couldnt eat ne more . . . i would have threw up if i ate n e more . but i did eat some of the desserts . . . still cant beat gary danko s dessert in my opinon ! was so not worth it here . . . . i could have eaten at the dinning room twice and the food was soooo much better there ! n n star because service was pretty good aside from what i had mentioned aboved nanother star , their dessert cart candies were delicious ! !

0,"happy hour might be a winner , but the regular dinner is a disappointment . our business meal started with the maitre d claiming quite arrogantly there was no reservation it was confirmed the week prior . after a minute wait our party was disenchanted with spotty service , uninspired food , and ultimately a bill that was well beyond what the meal warranted . you may not want to diss this place since others speak so highly of happy hour . but when it comes to full priced dinners . . . go elsewhere .

0,not sure it was worth the money . let me first start off the rooms are the bomb ! probably one of the nicest in vegas with everything in the room being controlled by computer . pretty cool being able to open the curtains to look at the view from your bed . speaking of the bed . . . incredible . . . . haven t slept so well in vegas ever . n nso why the two stars ? price gouging everywhere . our plane was delayed so we ended up getting in really late . . . to late to go looking for restaurants so we ended up eating at lemongrass . food was okay but not worth the price . great service but the food tasted like pf chang s . . . . sorry but true . we walked out . later and not super impressed do not mind paying for a good meal . n nnext day we went to spend the day at the pool . there are pools so we did not have a problem finding a chair and it was reasonably quiet it is vegas but when i asked for a pool menu i about lost it at the prices . . . . . most inexpensive sandwich was . without anything with it . . . . drinks were out of control as well . i know when you stay nice places food drinks are expensive but to me the prices they ask are not in line with the experience you get . n nit was a saturday so as the day went on the pool behavior was enough to make this red head blush ! i know it s vegas but there are some things i just do not need to see in daylight especially if i am sober because their drink prices are ridiculous . decided to go up to our room about before i saw things my eyes could not unsee . . . . and seriously questioned if i wanted to get into the pool the next day remembering what i had just witnessed . we were on the rd floor pool side and i could not take a nap it was going to be a long night because the pool noise was so loud . n nwe didn t eat there any other nights after the first night but had some cocktails in the lobby and again way overpriced . in the end i will say this the rooms are fantastic . . . no problem paying for them but keep the prices down everywhere else . . . . no reason to gouge your guests . the atmosphere outside the rooms just did not justify the costs . 
0,"i am not a food critic , i am more of a traveling foodie . so , from the reviews comments asserting this restaurant has the best chicken fried steak green chili in phoenix , that did not hold true for me . the food was not bad but not great . the combination omelet i had was quite good . the hash browns were ok but the oil used to fry them tasted old . the pancakes were just ok . the service was friendly . you get the atmosphere a decent local establishment that certainly has its following . they make their own hot sauces which i tasted . we went to try some place new . i am glad we did but it was a drive . i wouldn t go out of my way to go back anytime soon .

0,"we were looking for camping chairs and interested in checking out handguns for recreational target shooting purposes . this place is like the wal mart equivalent of outdoor gear tons of stuff that looks better than it is . i wasn t impressed by the condescending attitude of the gun guy when asked about the difference between the and guns , he answered it s the same thing like with cars one s a ferrari and the other s a ford . uh , helpful . . . . could you tell us what features are included with the gun vs the gun ? apparently not . n nalso wasn t impressed with the cheap quality of the chairs we saw . n nthis place may be an interesting draw for tourists and outdoor enthusiasts , as it boasts a large aquarium in the middle of the store and various stuffed animals not the cuddly kind ! . the store is huge either know what you want before you go or prepare yourself for a scavenger hunt . n ni tend to go to rei for my outdoor gear and will continue to do so , as their products are of higher quality and their staff genuinely wants to help you and they have experience in whatever sport or activity you re buying for .

0,"the crab rangoons are awesome ! the rest was mediocre . the eggrolls were ok . the rice was plain , edible with soy sauce . the general tso s chicken was bland , not sweet , just spicy and a bit soggy . they did say it would take mins for delivery an dit only took , so that was nice . but overall i won t be getting food here again .

0,"wow . this airline makes my usual airline look like the rolls royce of the skies and it isn t . yes , i was lucky enough to upgrade , but thank goodness ad i can t imagine how bad things are in the back of the bus . no audio or video service on a hour flight . the attendant in the first class cabin was super informal and casual . service and communication in general from these folks is super casual . don t get me wrong there is another airline that i personally love because they are casual . these guys pretend to be like other airlines , but take it down several notches . no lovely warmed nuts you get to pick a snack from a basket of potato chips or granola bars . service in both cabins apparently stops nearly an hour before the flight ends . gosh , maybe it does with other airlines , too , but i have never heard it announced so loudly and rudely . oh and even during service i almost felt i was back a a keg party . . . the cheap wine they offered with dinner was served in a large plastic cup . . . the size one would use to fill a cup of beer at the keg . . . . i can t make this stuff up . n ntwo stars rather than one as they did get me home safely . i guess that counts for something . "
0,this place used to be really good . they made the best tacos which they don t make anymore and green chili . the green chili has gone down hill you can tell they are cutting corners . they have raised their prices which is completely unjustified due to the quality going down . this place has now become nothing more than an eye sore and nuisance to the local neighborhood . close your doors and move on . 
0,"go check out jaleo instead ! the food was terrible , and not really a mix of the cultures , but rather , just serving individual chinese and mexican dishes . the service was not very attentive and very slow . won t find me there again . "
0,pricey . carnitas were fantastic and the guacamole was exceptional . margaritas were watered down and my girlfriends fish tacos were dry . mexican restaurants should have better drinks than this . 
0,"i had friend visit from out of town so i wanted to take her on a guided horseback tour . i made reservations with this company because i heard about it on groupon . when i looked at the website , the sunset tour caught my eye so i called to book it . no one answered so i left a voicemail . i called in the early afternoon but no one returned my call until am the following morning . i tried to book the sunset tour but all the lady said was we can t no legit reason but she offered us a tour at pm which was no big deal so i agreed . n non the day of our scheduled tour which was about a week after i booked the reservation i received a text message that read exactly like this need to cancel horse ride guide is sick i received this text at am when my tour was scheduled for pm . not only was it unprofessional for this business to send a text , i was only given hours notice . about minutes later i received a voicemail saying that their horse rangler is sick so they must cancel and to call back to confirm we received this message . she did not apologize whatsoever . n ni called about times before i could get ahold of anyone . when someone finally answered , i asked if there was anyone else available to guide the tour because my friend was leaving the next day and she said no . still she did not apologize . i explained to her how i thought it was inappropriate for her to send a text to cancel and she responded with well i asked you to call me back and when i told her i called about times and no one answered she replied well i saw you beeping on the other line but i was on the phone booking other tours her responses were contradicting and rude so i started yelling at her and only then did she start apologizing . at this point i was pissed so i hung up . n nzero stars for their unprofessionalism and rudeness but since yelp does not allow that i put one star . i would not recommend this company to anyone .

"
0,"let me sum up sweet cakes for you in two words . . . over rated . n nmy wife loves this place , and i can see why . the decor is as if the hobby lobby filled head of a molly mormon exploded inside a hole in a wall restaurant , and the resulting mess that came out was cookies and vinyl lettering surrounded by oil paintings of merchant allies in paris . if you re into that sort of thing , be my guest . otherwise , the paint jobs look unprofessional clearly no primer and sloppy lines , the design is inconsistent and the sitting bars by the windows are literally plank boards being held together by vice grips . as hard as they try to design the hell out of this place they did so by cutting corners , and it shows . very sloppy . n nthat brings me to another point , in what appears to be another effort to pinch every penny , sweet cakes has made a very critical anti consumer mistake and is now only accepting cash . they say they re going green which is bull . getting rid of a credit card machine doesn t do anything to support sustainability , but it sure is a nice way to get people to think you re not actually screwing them when they walk inside . all s not lost though sarcasm , seeing as how they only accept cash now , they ve conveniently provided an atm in their shop that you can withdraw cash from , and wouldn t you know it , it s owned by sweet cakes cafe gee , i wonder who gets a cut of that atm service fee for pulling out cash , nevermind the your bank will charge you in addition to the atm . it would be one thing if the owners passed on the burden of accepting debit and credit cards to the consumer by slightly raising prices heaven forbid ! , but it s a whole different thing to profit from the fact that the consumer has no choice other than cash in your establishment . n ni didn t try the deli items here , but from what i saw , i m glad i didn t . the pizza literally looked like the kind you would get from a school cafeteria lunch and the sandwiches didn t look particularly appetizing either . we did try the cookies and i have to say that i was really disappointed . they were too crunchy and hard . the snicker doodle was actually decent , but for the most part i could make better cookies than these at home . the only difference here is that they must use an ice cream scoop when baking them because they re so huge . speaking of which , if you go on saturday they have a buy cookies get free sale , and i put that in quotes , because the reality of the situation is that if you buy cookies , you will not get additional free . i wanted to buy cookies and get free because in my mind , when you say buy get free , unless there s a limit stated then it should extend to multiples of two , it s just common sense . but when confronted about it , the cashier claimed that it s buy or more and get free . that s a huge difference ! ! if the policy is free cookie per transaction then it should be clearly stated on the sign , instead , yet again sweet cakes has shown their anti consumer attitude by their unclear and misleading sale . n noverall , if i m going to spend on a sandwich , or . on a cookie , i m going to do it at paradise bakery or somewhere that i don t feel like they re trying to rip me off by selling me sub par goods at higher prices . i m all for supporting your local businesses , but when you can visit a shop once and determine that you don t even want to give it a second chance , you ve messed up .

0,"i ve stayed here twice now and both times the rooms were awful . customer service was fine , restaurant was okay . n nfirst time n nthe room was old , the carpet was torn , the blinds were broken , the drinking glasses were visibly dirty and the bathroom sink was a pedestal with barely enough room to fit the hand soap let alone a shaving razor . couldn t open the closet door all the way because the entry door closer got in the way . n nsecond time nwasn t offered a cookie , it was late so maybe there is a cut off time ? room was in overall better condition . i walked in and the room was freezing because the thermostat was set to . i turned the heat on but it didn t work so i called the front desk . they told me that because it was hot outside high s that the heat doesn t work . okay , no problem , i ll just open the window and let in some warm air . the front desk tells me , sorry , the windows don t open , do you want extra blankets ? . no , no i do not . i want a room that wasn t set to freezing prior to my arrival . n nboth times nthe walls are quite thin so you can hear your neighbors open and closing drawers . no fridge , the room layout severely underutilized the available space . for instance , the bathroom is tiny , yet there is a hallway alcove maybe ? that leads to the bathroom that could be walled off and tiled and would make the bathroom double the size . n ntl dr n n star budget hotel at a . star price . if you re paying full price check out the omni across the street or if you want something nicer and less expensive there is a nice hampton inn on smallman street .

0,"i ve heard some good things about this place , but not sure what all the hype is about . i went here for lunch today got the special spaghetti with corn green beans on the side . the spaghetti was mediocre at best , very bland unexciting with watery meat sauce i think i could make it better and i ve never made it the sides were canned not always an issue but they were flavorless . whoever posted about this place having fresh food is lying . i guess the atmosphere is attractive to some but i m not a fan of restaurants that don t dust or clean . sanitation rating . not impressive . the place was packed , i guess this is the cool spot where all the hip people come . i just want good , quality food to even begin to call this southern food is a disgrace to my culture . my friend got the southern chili said it was the consistency of a hormel chili , not great , not horrible . the cornbread he got was hard as a rock and was left uneaten after the first bite on the plate . the service was friendly quick , that s about the only positive i experienced . i won t be rushing back to lupies but since it is down the street from me i may try it again see if it can get more than a star rating . keep in mind , i m not a food snob but i know good food when i eat it this was far from good . . .

0,"talk about joke . no wonder this place is called culinary dropout . n nit was my girlfriend s birthday and her choice to eat here . i came a little later than pm on a sunday and it wasn t too busy to handle our person party . n nalready when i sat , i was greeted with my friends telling me not to order hennessy and or the oysters because they were out of it . hmmm , ohhkaaay i guess that ruled out those options . n ni ordered a moscow mule and was saddened when it came in a regular glass cup . sure , i would get a dollar off for bringing my own copper mug as stated on their menu but , who really carries around a copper mug . and if this place is gonna have assortments of mules then they need to have the mug ! n nas we chit chatted , the waiter comes back to tell my roomie that the olives he ordered for his anti pasti wasn t ready yet because it wasn t cured . what does that even mean my sassy tude was like , is it sick ? my roomie said to just bring out the bread , sundried tomatoes , and balsamic . it was decent . balsamic was sweeter than most i ve had . in the end , it wasn t anything special . n nmy friend , who was sitting next to me , got the salmon entr u e e . and lemme tell you that his first reaction to the dish was priceless almost jaw dropping awe lol nhis first words were this was ! hence the picture meme i have to go with this review the salmon was smaller than most salmon i ve bought at the grocery store . it laid on less than handful of brown rice and veggies . my friend said this would be the perfect dinner for someone on a diet too bad that aint me . funny thing is this is what the waiter recommended as the best thing on the menu . nmy friend had to share his girlfriend s burger and fries to get even some fulfillment . shrugs n ni shared the jambalaya with my roomie and that was spicy enough to my liking and even though the chicken , shrimp , and sausage jambalaya was mixed in with rice our asian asses still ordered a side of rice with it . nother friends got the steak , meatloaf , curry , and prime rib dip sandwich . everyone was pleased with their food but , in the end , it was nothing that stood out . n nall the while we re eating , we were never filled with our water nor ordered more alcohol . it was just a less blah . n neven their monkey bread dessert , which we were told could serve ppl , could not serve ppl . it was like bite sized cinnabon donut holes if they had that . n n nour waiter was funny tho and did the best he could with what he had , i m sure . nanother thing i m sure about is that i won t be back .

0,"hum . . . maybe i am spoiled by the original location in ny . for this place , i wasn t feeling it . natomsphere felt more like a denny s , light seems a bit dim , it was annoyingly dim . nservice could be better , i attempted to wave a waiter waitress hostess down to get my check , but they seem to all ignore me . ntook me about a good mins to finally get someone attention , and additional mins to get my bill . n ntheir pastrami sandwich was just okay , tasted more like a typical pastrami sandwich you can get anywhere . nmaybe i came in with too much hope for this place , but at the time we arrive , it was probably a given when there was no line . ni should have taken it as a hint that this place wasn t a hit in vegas . n nwill i come back ? nope . nwill i recommend this place ? nope . nwas the sandwich picture worthy ? not all at .

0,"this was possibly the worst italian meal i ve ever eaten . chicken saltimbocca was prepared wrong , thick rubbery chicken with a piece of prosciutto sitting on top , swimming in a yellow watery sauce . even the side of pasta was inedible , with a too sweet ketchup y meat sauce . save yourself your money stay away from this place .

0,"i was really excited to try this place considering i love the name and the fact that it s so burgh . one of my other friends had been there a few months prior and said it was a really cool place with good food , so i thought i d try it out . my friend and i went there the saturday after christmas for brunch lunch . we were initially impressed with the decor inside and our server was very nice . we both were in the mood for more of a lunch than brunch . at this time on saturday s , they only offer a very limited amount of choices that are not on the brunch menu . my friend got the egg burrito which she had ordered without onion and i got the pittsburgh steak salad . when we got our food , her burrito was filled with onions . she ended up picking them out . my salad was sub par at best . the only thing that i liked were the french fries and honestly how hard is it to screw that up ? my salad was drenched in this kind of gross ranch and had peppers all throughout it that were tasteless . my steak was cooked right , but the quality of the meat was not good . . . very chewy . the coffee was good but we did have to ask our server a few times to refill our drinks they had been empty for awhile and the place was dead . . . we were one of only three tables . the bathrooms were out of soap and toilet paper . when we told the staff they didn t seem to care . i have had better , fresher salads at getgo . i won t be back . . . ever . for what they charge and the quality of the food . . . i would choose another place . there are many other restaurants in town that offer much higher quality food for the price .

0,"this is the worst strip club i have ever been to . i have been to a lot of seedy clubs as well . i ve been to clubs where every chick is coked out of her mind to the point where she can t even dance , clubs where chicks are dancing around while the other strippers are watching their babies , even places where girls say they have been raped by club owners . nothing , and i mean nothing is as bad as this club . n nthe new york city bouncer out front was a nice guy , and thats where it stopped . the girls here are downright disgusting . these girls don t even look good enough to work the counter at mvd . the place is also crawling with undesirables at all times of the day and night . their drinks are about for a captain and coke , there were no girls dancing when we were there , the three girls who were working were basically asking if we wanted dances and when i said no , then rolled their eyes and walked away . well , maybe these girls could dance on stage and then ask for a private dance . . . i want to see what you re made of first . n nthe dress code out front , the disgusting women , the attitude from bartenders , and the overall grossness of this place earn it a one star . it would be negative one if it were an option . hi liter , bombshells , and even cheetah s are a ton better than this place . they are cheaper , have better talent , and are very friendly places . even the overpriced bourbon street would be a better bet than this .

0,"i visited this place hesitantly , , due to the reviews stating it had gone downhill and was pretty dirty . after scoping out the restrooms washed hands , it didn t seem as bad , seeing that i have been to restaurants in rd world countries as well as hole in the walls in the usa . nbut buyer beware ! ! ! ! ! ! do not go here ! ! ! ! ! i and my friend got severe food poisoning and i am sure many others that day . nausea , muscle weakness , the inability to focus and thus work and diarreahh and the whole yards nfor your own health s sake , do not come here ! ! ! ! it is not worth it ! ! ! i am vegetarian so i didn t even eat any meat and still got food poisoning . this is how unsanitary this place is ! i will be reporting them to the az health board . i am from ca and am not sure how this place is still running as i read someone else had gotten food poisoning as well . . . maybe the health standards in as are just not as strict in az . this place needs to be shut down ! ! ! i have never had food poisoning from eating out ! n nas a side note , the plates were dirty . also , despite the food tasting decent and the building construction being neat , don t let that fool you as it did to me ! !

0,i won t be coming back here . everything looks nice but the taste is not very good . the meal just tasted fake . 
0,"great wall of salt n nwe came here late on a saturday night , after a long day of work . we were starving and just needed food . pf chang s would not have been my first choice but one of the guys in our group was vegetarian , so we had to play it safe . n nwe decided to sit outside and do some people watching , while we were waiting for our food and drinks . there was a lot of crazy action on the strip . hey it is vegas and every night is crazy . the strange thing we noticed was that everyone stops to take a photo with the pf chang statue in front . why ? those people aren t even eating here . do they show there friends back home a photo of them standing on the strip in front of the pf chang s statue ? vegas tourists can be a little weird . n nour waitress kristina seemed to have a little attitude but then we found out she was originally from new york and that explained a lot . i know that sounds bad but i mean it as a compliment . she was sassy and full of attitude but then after realizing she was from ny we knew she was actually being nice . n ni started my night out with the organic margarita . it is one of my favorites . in fact , i make these same drinks at home . yes i stole the recipe from the pf chang s in mountain view , ca . my coworkers all went with mai tai s . we totally needed drinks after our long day . see most people come to vegas to have fun . for the last years i have been coming here for work , so i really do not know what vegas fun is anymore . as you can tell because i am getting excited about an organic margarita . look out vegas i am on fire . n nwe then decided to order a bunch of food . we started out with the two orders of the lettuce wraps . . . one chicken and one veggie . the tofu in the veggie lettuce wrap was disgusting . we also got a tuna tataki , which was really yummy . my favorite part was the jalepeno on top . i always like some spicy to my food . n nfor dinner we decided to grab a variety of dishes . we ordered the shrimp , chicken pork fried rice , chang s spicy chicken , tofu pad thai and the kung pao chicken extra spicy . n neverything was edible but extremely salty . we needed a couple of rounds of water to wash the salt down . honestly it was almost hard to eat but we were so hungry we just kept going . and i was not the only one at the table that made that comment , so i knew i was not being salt crazy . n ni would like to feel like i know authentic food . one of the best things in my life was getting to work in asia and actually getting to experience the amazing food . but the bad part about these experiences is that it ruins the taste of most of the asian food available in america including chains like these . n nto recap my evening here our waitress was great . my drinks were delicious but the food was just okay . i can hardly believe , at one time , i was in love with pf changs but i am just not in love with it anymore . i wish i could share more but i just wasn t that impressed . i honestly don t have that much to say , which is strange for me .

0,my air conditioning stopped working so i called a few companies and they were the only ones to answer on a sunday night . they came at am and said i needed a new motor . i was charged for the replacement and diagnostic fee and it was done within an hour . it seemed to be working so i left for work . i came home later that evening to a house . i called and they came back within an hour . they said the new motor they put in was defective and replaced it with another new one . not even a week later and it s broken again . i called again and they said they d be here in the morning . so now i m sitting here packing me and my crying kids bodies with ice in a house trying to sleep till morning . 
0,"i can t wait until we get back to chicago ! so , this place was recommended by one our friends that live here so we thought we ll give it a try . i ordered the sweet and sour chicken . . . . why is there only one piece of pineapple in what is suppose to be sweet and sour sauce ! at least when i go to other chinese restaurants in chicago , i get red peppers , onions , and more pineapples ! the sauce was pretty good as well as the chicken . my husband enjoyed his food which was good . wished we checked our food before we left because we ended up sharing rice . we ll have to find another chinese place when we visit again !

0,"this was a second visit for me . i t had been a few years and last time i had a pretty good round . this visit was a bit surprising for me . first , they claim same day reservations as they are the largest spa in the country or the world . when i walked up for a service to be schedule later in the day between and i was told that most of the massage types i was requisition were not available and then i found one and then he said it was booked while we were talking . so , i ended up with just a general massage which was fine and he did give me off for my troubles . now , that is not really a big deal as this is an easy discount to get but i appreciated the effort . i think this was more of a staffing issue than anything else with the availability . n nwhen i got there ahead of time it took them quite a while to get me back so i had almost zero time to spend in the steam room and sauna . what i noticed that was different this time was that the massage rooms seemed to be almost like a cheap row of motel rooms . the massage was nothing stellar , just run of the mill . this is where the biggest disappointment would occur . n ni left my key ten miles back in the room . now , i do not think there is any way you could remember which room you had been in . if there was , i never saw it . i asked the locker room attendant if he could help . he looked for my intake form and could not find it . then , he just pawns it off on another employee who was very irritated to be bothered . finally , when he found the slip which has been misfiled because the guy wrote hi t like an l or something he walked over to my locker and opened it and then just walked off . now , this gave me no opportunity to shower or anything without leaving my locker open . very poor service and frankly unacceptable . i will not likely return when in vegas . n ni did want to bring this to a manager s attention on my way out but they had one person working the desk and a line of three folks and i had a dinner reservation to get to and now have to get to my room to shower .

0,"after convincing my wife and kids to go out to dinner on mother s day , the question became where ? after reading reviews on yelp , we decided to try la calabria ristorante . i am not allowed to pick restaurants anymore . n nthe food was mediocre and bland . n nsalads were a cup of iceberg lettuce with paper thin slices of carrots and radishes . n nthe fillet wrapped in puff pastry crust was tender , but overpowered by the mushroom sauce gravy . the broccoli was mush and very bland . my wife had the seafood linguine which was simply ok . the same for my daughter s ricotta stuffed gnocchi , just ok . n ndesserts were decent with the exception of the tiramisu and cheesecake , both lackluster . the cheesecake was not creamy or smooth , just grainy . the flourless cake was good , wish we all ordered that . n nservice was fair considering it was mother s day , but another server or two could not have hurt . they do serve alcohol , but there is not a bartender on staff . if it comes out of a bottle , you are good , otherwise , think flask so much for a lemon drop martini . n nperhaps being from chicago and growing up in northern italy , i am too critical , but not our go to choice for italian .

0,"moved in the first of the year and thought we found the perfect place to start our new life in the las vegas area while we looked for a home to purchase . nice complex , nice units , a little on the pricey side but we felt like it was a good safe start until we got familiar with nevada . it wasn t long before we realized that many of the tenants in the complex with pets do not clean up their animal s waste even though the complex provides stations with bags . we brought this to management s attention in january and again in february . after complaining yet again in march we have been told by management that this is common among complexes that allow pets and it is impossible to enforce the complex rules regarding this matter . we knew moving from a home of years to an apartment there would be some adjustments and differences to get used to , but we never imagined animal waste would be one of them . we thought it was nice that apartments allowed pets , they didn t back in our day when we were renters , and had no idea such problems existed . not sure which is more frustrating management that admits it can t enforce its own rules or people with such lack of consideration for their neighbors . n nif you don t mind neighbors who leave animal waste , the flies and other problems it creates , then this place is perfect . n nbeing new to the state our experience here has not left a very good first impression of the area or its residents . needless to say we will not renew our lease and cannot wait to get out of this complex .

0,"came in on a friday night to have dinner with the family food was ok , nothing to write home about . avoid coming to this place on the weekend if you want to have a conversation with your guest . the tacatacas and karaoke dj make it impossible for you to talk and enjoy your food . its becomes a bar full of depressed fat girls singing songs that make you want shoot yourself . also , make sure you check your bill the wait staff tends to over charge . too pricey for south phoenix .

0,"i give this place absolutely zero stars . the only reason i even rated it with one star , was because i couldn t post a review without a rating . the food is disgusting , the place is dirty , even when grabbing a fork i couldn t find one that wasn t greasy . i took about three bites of a slice of pizza and immediately went back up to the counter and asked for a full refund . the manager wasn t nice , was not the slightest bit polite . the only nice thing i really have to say about this restaurant was that when i walked in someone greeted me and said welcome to cicis pizza , however he did not have a smile on his face . do yourself a favor and don t bother even coming .

0,my boyfriend was extremely excited about going to this restaurant . he went last night . no bueno for him . i wish i could give no stars for this review . he had the catfish and macaroni meal . told me it was oily and odd flavor but was open to finishing it . he was sick for over hours . he got food poisoning . throwing up in my car times on the way to get my dinner two blocks away and back near home at the walgreens on the corner he threw up twice as i was getting him ginger ale and crackers and advil for his fever and chills after each heavy heave . he had the shakes all night . nothing but that horrible fish and mac n cheese came out of him . i felt so bad for him . he saved his appetite that morning just to have room for the meal . don t eat the fish ! better yet find another soul food spot without the vomit . glad i passed on this meal instead of passed out like he did .

0,"sadly , this is the only chinese restaurant close by . . . soooo dissappointing ! ! ! ! ! the food is not good chinese food at all , the fried rice is barely fried , and the shrimp fried rice only comes with like shrimp on it . i have had not so great chinese food from other places in the past , but this place is not even tolerable . . . i made an order to go and waited approximately hr mins ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! during the time of me waiting families had came in , ate their food and left also there were other people who brought their food back because the order was wrong i finally get my food , get out to the parking lot , and decide to check it before i leave . . . my order was wrong ! ! ! ! ! i take it back in , and another lady followed behind who made it all the way home with my order before she realized it was wrong . . . so i waited another minutes . no apologies , no discounts . . . nothing ! ! ! then i get home and the food was just disgusting ! ! ! i was so upset . . i will never eat there again . . . . n ni will admit , if you dine in , you get more options with the buffet of some halfway decent food , as far as the chicken and things like that . n n we need a good chinese restaurant in maricopa . . please someone rescue this place and show them how its done ! !

0,went there for dinner with some friends . i was not impressed at all . the shrimp appetizer was ok . the jambalaya was spicy hot good but mostly because it was swamped with black pepper bad . all i tasted was black pepper . service was slow and i never got a refill on my drink or even my water .

0,"let s be truthful . . . n nlast week i decided to treat my wife to an evening of pretending to be a tourist on the strip . i booked a room at the ti and after check in , took my hungry bride to the buffet to graze on a strip buffet offering . i stepped up enthusiastically feeling fortunate there was no line and paid the per person to get in . n nas we walked through the dining area i noticed about diners in the restaurant odd for a pm dinner i thought who were not really eating much . must be a convention of health nuts as most plates were fruit and snacks . . . no real food . we arrived to the line and my wife looked at me and said . . . n n is it just me , or does this entire place look tired ? n ni thought to myself and replied , sweetie , i don t understand why all the hot food has a dried skin on top , the cold food is shriveled , and the employees are all frowning . . . but that doesn t effect how much fun we ll have tonight , right ? after seeing her expression , i immediately stated that we were leaving and requested a refund from the overly understanding lady at the register . n nnotwithstanding the terrible looking food , the strain on the faces of the line cooks resembling a hollywood production of someone pointing a gun in their backs to work there or else . . . i found the saddest part to be how unfazed and prepared the smiling lady at the register was when i asked for a refund . we left , walked across the street to the palazzo and enjoyed a great italian dinner . n n npersonal note to phil ruffin , owner of the ti n ni was born and raised in las vegas , and this was my first experience staying in a strip hotel casino . i m proud of our city and welcome every visitor with open arms to enjoy all the entertainment and great dining las vegas has to offer . this buffet , the air quality in the casino , the poor cleanliness of the room , our room had burnt out light bulbs , yuck on the dresser , broken dresser drawer hanging out , and empty alcohol bottles under the bed and chair and the lack of smiles on the employees faces is not what i envisioned any tourist should experience . when this property opened it was fantastic , enjoyable , and affordable , and most important the air was breathable . when we arrived in our room , my wife had to do a breathing treatment because the horrible air inflamed her asthma . perhaps you ll take these recommendations to heart ? n nif you have a similar experience at this or any other las vegas property , please write a truthful review so the hotel owners get the message and step up their game . i would be happy to stay at the ti again and perhaps encounter an experience deserving of a glowing review , which i would be proud to post . until then . . .

0,"nice guys , but the painters do not know what they are doing and their satisfaction guarantee and guarantee for two years is worthless . there is no one to back it up and the franchise that we used could not have cared any less . we are very unhappy with the quality of workmanship things are worse than before they came . we have used students in other cities and never had a problem i think someone needs to offer these kids some training , can t just give them a brush and paint and send them out to do a job . very disappointing we support student services whenever possible but would not go near these guys again .

0,"last weekend while running some errands in charlotte , my husband , daughter and myself decided that it was time to hit up the cheesecake factory . any other time we have gone , the food is always okay but pricey and we always get two pieces of cheesecake to share . this time around , my husband ordered the meatloaf lunch and when he got it , the meatloaf was dry and he compared it to chow hall food in the military . he said chow hall food was better than that ! when the waiter came back like minutes later , i told him that the food as gross . he took it away and never said a word . the manager popped up about minutes later and offered him a menu but told him that everyone s tastes are different and they have never had a complaint about the meatloaf before . my thoughts were , it s dry and tough . . . . who would eat that ? my husband just ordered a soup and salad lunch combo after he got another menu which was priced at like . the salad was horrible and the soup tasted like vegetable water almost . when our waiter came to the table , of course i had to be the one to call out the issues because my husband won t and i didn t want to have to pay for something that he didn t eat . of course they did nothing about it . they just brought out the cheesecake and made us pay for a meal he did not eat or enjoy . since i m heading to charlotte for my th birthday next weekend , i will definitely remember not to go back there and they won t get our business again . we will just mosey on over to maggiano s for our next big business meeting .

0,"work in the area , so i ve stopped by with coworkers countless times . the service has been bad out of times . but the food is some of the best indian food in town , lunch specials are really good and the happy hour is great , so until now i just put up with it . . . n n . . . until today , when i tried to call in an order and they hung up on me . three times . literally just clicked the button to end the call without even picking up , and left me in a confused silence i had full bars . i hope it was just a phone problem , but honestly , it didn t seem that way . n nalso , splitting a check here is an absolute nightmare . they write all the checks by hand and refuse to get some form of electronic system . i understand that splitting a check ways is crazy , but there s only typically of us . depending on who waits on you , they will throw a fit when you ask to split the bill . the saving grace though , is there s one waiter who s always really good and will do it for us no problem . everytime we go , we pray that we get placed in his section . . . haha . n nhonestly i can t say i won t come back , because there isn t much else in the area and the food itself is really good . but don t expect any form of hospitality , and don t bother during full price hours . the dinner prices aren t work this . i m not a fancy restaurant type of person , i don t require top notch service . but i d at least like to not wait minutes for food during my lunch hour , then another for the waitress to bring the bill , and have her get angry at us for trying to pay the damn bill .

0,this place is kinda depressing . i would normally never go here or a place like this in las vegas on my own but had to because of a group of business folks i was with . they had live music but it was very drab . happy hour had decent prices but the food was very underwhelming . service was pretty horrible so we are assuming the girl was new or trained horribly . i don t recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving . 
0,"when a restaurant has the nerve to charge exorbitant prices for food , i damn well better get the best taste and the best service in my entire life . you will not get either one at nobu . i came here the other night treating an unemployed friend for dinner , what a sham . ni asked the sushi chef what is good that day and he recommended the king crab roll . we said ok and this little roll came out and the taste was simply ok . i was not impressed at all . i was actually quite annoyed . i ordered some uni and monkfish liver . now when i order monkfish liver at any other sushi spot , i either get pieces of sushi or a few medallion sized sashimi . at nobu , i got one medallion sized piece on a gigantic plate that was covered in this peach sauce . i was becoming rather bored and none of this tiny shit was fulfilling my appetite . i asked the chef what he has that s unusual and off the menu . he said the yellowtail or white tuna , you know , cuz no other sushi place has that ! i told him something a little more unique and he just didn t know what to offer . finally he said live octopus . i ordered it and it just kinda arrived in front of me . i imagined it would ve been prepared in front of me or shown to me before cutting it . . anything . i have no idea where it came from or how it looked . it was drenched in some sort of clear vinegar like sauce with green stuff and all i tasted was this crap all over it . ni got the bill and almost ran the hell out ! it was . for that crap ! we ordered lychee martinis which were good , not worth for of them . twenty five dollars for the crab roll ! for the octopuss ! for the uni . i payed in absolute anger and disgust , left a tip and got the hell out of there . nhonestly , i am a harsh critic , i admit that . however , i feel financially raped by this place and am losing sleep over it . the food was so not worth it . anyone who knows sushi really well wouldn t be caught in this lame over priced trap . it should be illegal to serve crap sushi covered in taste bud overdose sauce ! i will never ever go near nobu again and will warn people waiting to not bother . nhere s a big middle finger to nobu nationwide .

0,iced coffee was okay . service was terrible . 
0,"it was this or the shawarma joint at university commons . decided to see what the buzz around boyz was since i haven t been to the toronto location . nmy first impression was that it is a huge step in comparison to bandidos or big fat . the restaurant is easily x the size of the former and x the latter . i feel like this was to capture the weekend partying from phil s and probably does a good job at handling the volume . n nthe pricing was a bit confusing as they do not offer two different tortilla sizes , instead the sizes indicated the amount of filling used . ni got a small bean burrito without the cheese , and extra spicy w the works . npricing was good and comparable to bandidos ! meaning big fat s is still the most expensive of the three . n nthe cook time felt longer than bandidos and they also do not use a flat press to help with the grilling do maybe that s why it took longer to cook while coming out fairly soft . i enjoyed the softness of the burrito , though personally i do enjoy a slightly crunchier wrap . the longer cook time might be a liability during the post club rush just a thought . n ni felt that the initial bite was underwhelming as the tortilla wasn t proportional to the quantity of filling , they really should get two sizes of tortilla . as i worked my way through the burrito it started getting better , their formula for the beans is very good though i would pass on the burrito sauce , and hot sauce . both were poor quality with the latter being mild at best . n noverall food experience was decent , but they haven t won me over as a loyal customer . i ll take their burritos when i m in loo but if i m in toronto it s bandidos for me !

0,"went here recently and it smelled like open sewage i think they were burning incense to hide the bad smell . actually i have been here twice and it smelled like sewage both times the men s bathroom is disgusting , the service is horrible , a customers food was left next to me at the bar for several minutes until the waitress picked it up to bring to a customers table anyone could have played with the food during that time . the bartender couldn t handle more then customers , the decor is pathetic and looks like a sloppy college student decorated his dorm room with all his sports posters i expected to see a pile of dirty socks and underwear in the corner . nthey don t appear to have much to choose from for drinks , don t expect any quality liquor the menu is very standard . didn t dare try the food . n nit s too bad , i could really like this place , because the location is great .

0,"we went in there about a week after it opened and had a really bad experience there . the beer was good , and the server we had was good , but the food was awful and the experience we had with the manager was what ultimately ruined the experience . we ordered wings , and a quesadilla . the wings looked and tasted either like they had been sitting out for an hour , or they were deep fried to a crisp . the quesadilla had decent flavor , but was only about of an inch thick and had very little filling , definitely not worth the for such a small amount of food . there are a lot of places in downtown i can go and get full for , this was like a bite snack . n nbut , since we live downtown , and we like to support our local businesses , and considering the fact that they had only been open a week or so , we thought we d give some helpful constructive feedback to the management in hopes they might improve . so we asked to talk to a manager to tell him about the food . n nso this guy comes over and we tell him the wings taste way too overdone , and the quesadilla tasted alright but was a poor value at . we told him we were local , we were polite , and that we knew they had only been open a week and we wanted to help them work out the kinks . n nthe manager immediately got really defensive and tried to tell us that the wings were fine and that everyone else in the place who ordered them loved them and that they only use the very best ingredients and that s why the quesadilla was so expensive . then he basically tried to tell us that we were wrong and that there was no way that the food could have been that bad . we were just trying to help a local place succeed , and this guy put a really bad taste in our mouth . n narguing with a customer and trying to convince them that the bad food they just ate wasn t really bad is a perfect example of how not to run a restaurant . all he had to do was simply say thank you for the honest feedback , we will consider your recommendations , and we would love it if you would come back and have a free appetizer on us so that you can see we re committed to improving . we would have been back a dozen times by now , and told all our friends about it . but instead he was a jerk . n nwe thought about coming back again after a few months , but every time we think about it , we just think of the manager . and besides , there are lots of other great places in downtown phoenix that have better , cheaper food , and good beer too . so we haven t been back , and we probably won t ever unless something changes .

0,"i ll give this place stars because they had veggie burgers . they were bland and had no real toppings to speak of but it s better than nothing if you don t want meat . n nwhat made this place the pits was the service . we stood in line for minutes while the hostess flirted with a drunk guy in front of us who wasn t even waiting on a table . she could feel everyone staring at her like wtf ? ? , but she didn t care . n nshe then tried to seat us wedged in between two other , two person , tables like a cafeteria ? , instead of one of the many other open tables . n nwant ketchup ? a refill ? eating utensils ? napkins ? be prepared to ask for all of them and to have the server act like you are inconveniencing them and they are doing you a favor .

0,"not a bad place , but really pricey even for an airport . i had a margarita and a shrimp taco plate with about cup of rice and cup of black beans . the shrimp tacos were ok , with melted cheese and a little bit of cabbage . but they definitely left me wanting something . the margarita was good , but not very strong for the price i paid . i would have probably rathered have a glass of wine or a beer . not a bad place to have a meal , but not great either .

0,"this place is expensive . it was a novelty to try a gordon ramsay burger , in fact i even gave this place a nd chance after being disappointed the first time . that s how much i wanted to like this place . n nthe presentation of the food was great but the flavor was just plain boring . it didn t have any unique flavor . it was just average . also , both times i visited , i asked for the burger to be cooked rare , but got medium rare . not a deal breaker but when you are paying for just the burger with no fries included , you expect to be able to get it cooked right . n nhonestly , carl s jr . , wendy s in out make better burgers . each fast food joint has a unique flavor to their burgers , but gordon ramsey just refuses to take any chances . it all tastes bland even though it looks like it s going to taste amazing . n ni spent over on myself for a burger , fries , shake and beer with tip . not to mention it is hard as hell to get to this restaurant unless you are walking along the strip . you have to park behind the miracle mile shops and walk all the way through the shopping mall to get back to the strip . not an easy ordeal . n ni don t recommend this place for locals . it s clearly aimed at the impulsive tourists . nothing more than a cash grab for gordon ramsay .

0,"stood at the counter for about minutes . cashier was busy with someone else , had many items in my arms so i put them on the counter . a woman wearing a red t shirt comes up looks past me and says she ll help the next person standing in line . completely ignores me standing there looking at her . now i shop this store every two weeks and i m usually a happy customer , but this woman made me so mad i left the place and spent my money at k mart . screw that ! ! !

0,"they screwed up my drink twice and finally made it right the rd time . i m talking major screwup , like a grande latte instead of the ice venti vanilla latte i ordered . oh and it took minutes from when i pulled into the drive through til actually leaving the window . i could see people getting upset in their cars . i hope it s not always like this .

0,"i ve tried to use my groupon multiple times at this place . they never answer their phone . i live across town but wouldn t mind picking this up on my way home . the hours seem to be a bit early for closing , but i suppose that this is their call . the bottom line is that if they are trying to run a business they need to answer the phone .

0,"i love chipotle . the reason for the stars is because of the staff . they seemed unorganized , inefficient , and unprofessional . most of the other locations are very efficient and organized , especial around a busy lunch time . before starting down the line , i saw containers we empty veggies cheese . when it was my turn i had to wait about minutes for them to make veggies . normally , when you see an item getting low , it is being prepared and then placed in a clean new container . they were preparing the veggies and then poured them in the old container that had been empty in the filling station . then one check out it seemed the person asking what else you d like had to told a few times what you wanted because he seemed kind of spacey and not there . overall , my first uneasy and weird at a chipotle .

0,"i have to say that i think i am over it . i am from la originally , and maybe i have just been spoiled by really good and cheap thai food . when i moved to vegas , this was my go to thai spot , partly because someone recommended it and partly because there was not much else to choose from in our area . pin kaow has some decent tasting food , but my biggest problem is that i feel like the portion sizes are getting smaller , and it is just not worth the price .

0,"i ll start off by saying that i m not a huge fan of the epicentre , not that i don t drop in from time to time , just not a huge fan . . . too many hipsters n nthat being said , i decided to give blackfinn a shot . i have now been in two or three times . the food is decent , nothing that will blow you away , but not bad either . the chicken sliders are good , as is the seared tuna salad . the waitstaff seems to be very friendly and attentive . the place can seem to draw in a large crowd on weekends , so the service suffers a bit to be expected , i guess . n nthe beer selection is boring , only a handful of taps and they are mainly bud , miller , coors type beers . at a beer i expected them to at least carry a couple of local or regional beers . n nif you are at the epicentre and are looking for a good place to have a beer , there are better places . n nover all this is not a bad place , but it s nothing special either . . .

0,"we have been eating at various logans roadhouse restaurants accross the usa for a very long time now . with that said i must ask how do you run out of porterhouse steaks ! ! ! the manager should be fired for running out of steak in a steakhouse . we drove mins to this logans just to find out the signature steak is not in stock . we will never return to this location for that reason . n nwe did stay and got served horrible food . the lobster shrimp dip was soured that sickly sweet taste . it had the taste of old seafood set out too long . so we sent it back for the nashville trio of fried pickles , onion rings , and mozzarella sticks . the fried pickles were served as a big wad all stuck together and it was all dripping with oil . salads came out next . they were fine , it s a salad . n nentrees were prime rib shrimp special for the wife and i ordered an old favorite the chopped steak . my wife ordered her prime rib medium and it arrived extra well done . you could hear the sawing it took to break off a piece . not a spot of red anywhere in that steak . it also looked manged as though it was the end tip no one wanted a week ago . shrimp was ok but that s it . my chopped steak ordered mid career was also cooked super well done . not a speck of juice anywhere in that check of dust . basically everything was cooked to the point of inedible . so we ask for the manager . n nthe manager started a blame game of her people and blah blah blah that i should never of had to hear . if this is normal and you have such problems with your people not cooking food properly you either retrain them or get rid of them . what you do not do throw your hands in the air and bla . e everyone else . as manager you are responsible . no one else . n nthe only thing that was good was my wifes prickly pear margarita . she loved it tons . will be her new goto drink at another logans in the future . so we ended up paying for the margarita and left a big tip for the waitress who was wonderful . we have to remember it s not our servers fault that the kitchen can not cook your food properly .

0,it s a huge problem when the food is worse than the service . i gave this place another shot and it s still just a terrible place to go . they need to rewrite their menu on the pizzas and just call them breadsticks . . . that s what they are . and they re pretty terrible . go to papa johns y all .

0,"i first visited carver s in october for a family member s birthday and couldn t have had a more perfect evening , from first greeting , to a great waiter and excellent food . because of that , and having a small family , we decided to try it for thanksgiving dinner , which is always risky . i made the reservation a month in advance and asked several questions about their plan , which sounded perfect . on arrival we were led through the entire restaurant , through a back door into their storage room literally . it was behind a set of double doors usually kept closed , the walls were like particle board painted orange with some tacky wall fixtures , no windows and the neon exit light over the industrial back door . there were three tables crammed in this room which could have been card tables . i immediately complained and was told that was all that was available . when i asked about the empty table for six in the restaurant we just passed , i was told that had already been requested . after complaining again to our waiter about being seated in the storage room , he laughed and agreed with me . he also then relayed a story to us about a woman in the restaurant who was literally crying because they told her the pie was not included in the price of the thanksgiving dinner , so after debating what to do with her they decided to comp her meal . all while i m still steaming because we couldn t receive better treatment . at that late date there weren t a lot of options so we stayed . n nif anyone has any intentions of planning a dinner party at this restaurant , i would recommend you have a signed agreement on the seating plan before spending an evening in a storage room .

0,"well , their happy hour ends at but it is a pretty good happy hour . half off some of their cocktails , wine and what not and half of some rolls and other apps . what gets me is the wasabi is actually blue . yes , that s the name and all but do we really need to be so contrived as to actually load up the patrons with blue no . and maybe a touch of green no . ? that just grossed me out to no end . the intensity of the color still disturbs me . their second strike is the name of their rolls . really , i want something presented to me as the dirty sanchez and the me soy horney ? they all tasted fine but the names alone did them in . we won t be back . i had been to the location in north scottsdale probably four years ago but it was after wine tasting and we were all wasted so maybe that s the key to a good meal here . complete obliteration .

0,"a visit to portovino will remind you how easy it is to claim that you re something special , and how different it is to prove it . n nif you ve read my other reviews , you ll know i love my sushi grade tuna steaks . i enjoy going to a restaurant and trying their version , especially when the server tells me how good it is . n nportovino s tuna steak , at , was actually . x . x approx . cubes . is that enough for a meal ? is that worth anywhere close to ? nah . not even close . the pieces were nice , but the multi coloured sesame seeds added nothing . in fact , they took away from the dish . i cut off the edges to eat them first otherwise i would have starved to leave just the tuna to finish my meal if you can call it that . the tuna was tasteless , which was an absolute shame . surprisingly and thankfully the wasabi sauce that decorated the plate helped and was not as overpowering as i feared . the side mashed potatoes and vegetables peppers and zucchini were actually better prepared than the fish . shaking my head . quite disappointing , especially considering that of the of us at the table who ordered the tuna , no one was impressed but that might be because i got the best looking tuna of all of them . one person got pieces instead of my , but the th was a tiny , scrap end piece that should have been eaten by the chef instead of served . n nthe service was pleasant , thank you . n nthe minestrone soup was very tasty , and some in our party did enjoy their meals , despite various degrees of temperature accuracy . n nunfortunately , one person ordered a filet , medium rare . it was served well done ! ! with the rest of the dishes , and when she sent it back , it took minutes ! ! ! ! ! to come back rare , at best , but mostly raw . unedible . n nwe joked at how pissed off gordon ramsay would have been , but the real joke is portovino , but without the laughter . pretentious and uninspired . i don t like these qualities in people , and i hate them in establishments that charge a fee for the privilege of eating there . this visit was not my idea and i was not the host , and i guarantee i ll be choosing a different place when i do make the choice . n nif i didn t reserve my star ratings for those establishments that were shockingly bad , portovino might qualify . however , kind mark awards them stars but they are really small stars , and very expensive .

0,"we were very underwhelmed with rick s . it s a cool setting , very nice hotel , mediocre food , and decent service . altogether , it s stars . n nwe ate a late breakfast on a weekday . there were only other tables in the joint , and one of those was finishing up . we still had to wait a bit for water at the beginning , although i will say refills got better as the meal went on . i had the breakfast wrap , which was a wheat tortilla filled with eggs , ham , onions , a little crema , and cheese . it was served with salsa , which had to come out of a jar from the store , and pico . the pico was homemade and a nice blend of tomato , onion and cilantro . no heat , but good flavor . i ate all of it and only had one bite of the salsa , which i imagine comes from new york city . this comes with a side of potatoes . they thinly slice potatoes , season them with a few herbs , and fry them . but , it seemed as though the oil was not hot enough . some potatoes were fried very well , others were limp and oily . also , all lacked seasoning , i didn t detect any salt or pepper , and potatoes need salt . this dish , if executed , would be solid . but , it wasn t , so they weren t great . n nthe wife had ham and eggs . it s a huge meal , very large piece of ham with eggs , pieces of toast , and the aforementioned potatoes . this was what you would expect . nothing to write home about , just a large average breakfast . n nthe prices are a little high for what you are getting , but you are in the westin and it s a nice setting . we had to sit there for some time to get our bill , that was an annoying end to the meal . my star review is not based on the prices , it s based on the food and service . we may return , but i think it ll be awhile .

0,the lady at the front takes your jacket because she just wants your tips . she is just so grumpy and doesn t really feel like being there . the food and service was ok . not worth the money . there are so many other restaurants nearby . the owner or the lady who forces you to take your jacket was arguing w her employees and saying they should be privileged to work here . i felt like this restaurant should be on restaurant impossible . the wait staff was arguing w each other while the owner watched . the only reason people come here because if its location not the food ! if you want good food don t come here ! 
0,"meh . i was really excited to try this place out . n nthe inside is a lot bigger than i expected and the decor is lovely . the service was really good too ! n nbut the most important part , the food , just lacked . the chips and salsa guacamole were good . oh and the sangria . n nwe started off with the crispy quesadilla which was good . maybe serve it with a side of sour cream ? n ni had the lunch special with chicken flautas and a pulled chicken taco . i didn t like the flautas , plus i expected them to be crispy . . . didn t care for the rice and usually i love mexican rice . the taco was alright . my boyfriend had the enchiladas . he thought they were alright , nothing special . for this , plus a beer the total was , probably won t return unless it s just for drinks at the bar .

0,"had lunch there today . first of all , the prices are outrageous . for a burger with cheese , lettuce tomatoes ? that s the meet your maker burger the one i ordered . oh you want fries ? . extra for that . so . for a smallish burger fries . my friend got the standard deluxe with fries . she asked for bacon was told that they could bring bacon out on a side plate next to the burger but no , they would not add the bacon onto the burger before serving it to her . that s some hipster nonsense right there . whatever . n nso first i get the wrong burger . as in , not the one i ordered . i send it back . i watch my friend eat of her food before my correct burger comes out . i ordered it pink . it came out extremely well done . this is like the tenth time that i have attempted to order a pink burger gotten one that was well done at burgatory . i mean , it s literally a joke to me at this point . i wasn t even surprised that they overcooked it . my friend suggested i send it back again but at this point , she was done with her food i wasn t waiting another minutes . oh and guess what else ? our buns were very stale . nice tough crumbly . yum . n nthe bill comes . . . nothing was comped . i wasn t expecting a free meal but maybe free french fries ? or off the bill ? nothing . n ntotal price for two iced teas two burgers with fries ? . thirty five dollars . i tipped the waitress on top of that , even though she messed up my order . so that brought it to . n nif you want mediocre food not cooked to order , an attitude about adding bacon to your burger and to be price gouged , then by all means , continue to patronize this overrated chain restaurant . otherwise , skip it .

0,"we waited an hour for a table after being told it would only be min . we were finally notified our table was ready but , when we went to the hostess , she told us there was a mistake and we d have to wait an other min . unfortunately we had prior plans that made it impossible to wait any longer . i don t mind waiting but , i don t like being lied to .

0,"if i could , i d give and a half stars . it was not bad for the money . my boyfriend and i stayed one night there for our st b days and for the most part , it was fine for us . i like how at check in , you get a coupon book with a lot of free and half price stuff . we got one free drink each and free admission to a night club , lax , which was nice . however , i wouldn t recommend the cat house . it s very small and smokey and the drinks i got were horrible . we also got other coupons to restaurants in the luxor and excalibur . the room was nice and updated , there was one corner where the wall paper was starting to peel , but it was no big deal . the bed was very comfy ! i did notice a couple weird things , i left my laptop on the desk in the room , plugged up to the wired internet . when we came back , it was unplugged and the cord looked like it was thrown behind the desk and the alarm clock was also going off , which we did not even set . we put a do not disturb sign on the door , but i don t know , i kind of felt like someone came in . nothing was missing , thankfully . when we first got there , we wanted to leave our bag with the bell desk and the people there were very rude . but we got the bag checked and then at check in , the people there were very nice . what i d like to see less of are those annoying time share people . they try to stop everyone and even when you say no and walk away , they re still yelling out to you .

0,"to quickly summarize , staff is impatient and mediocre food . n ni absolutely love naked fish sushi bar but it s on the other side of town so i ve been desperately trying to find a place that can come close . i always drive passed this place so i figured i d give it a shot , definitely regret walking in . a few things n n it was freezing inside n the tap water had a weird taste . maybe it was the glasses ? stil , yuck . n service ok once you ordered but until them they stare at you and constantly come over to see if you re ready . note , their menu is huge . it took me almost mins to look thru the menu . n menu caters to ayce dinner because the prices are so high . all rolls are over . you can half certain rolls btw . n rainbow roll unfortunately i halfed this roll , it was the better of the two rolls i tasted but was nothing special . n happy ending far from it ! weird flavor combo . a vamped up philadelphia roll with lemon slices and garlic ponzu sauce . it was mainly a garlic and lemon roll since they over powered the rest of the roll and left a bad taste in the mouth . n ni was not impressed unfortunately . with all the great reviews , my hopes were high .

0,service night wasn t ver good . for a party of they only gave us menu said they ran out of menus . they sat us in the back dining room which was dark unwelcoming . we just decided that this place wasn t for us politely told the waitress we were leaving . the restaurant only looks good from the outside .

0,from the frozen hash brown patty to the overcooked low quality ingredients in the breakfast burrito and the almost absent service this place is the lowest of the low vegas has to offer . a shame for this location . 
0,the apartments are being renovated but the staff is still rude . they definitely need customer service training . the act like they are doing you a favor by speaking to you . the maintenance crew still needs work it does take weeks to get someone in and it usually takes a few tries before they get it fixed correctly . the grounds are well maintained and the people i have met were nice enough . really just needs a different management company . 
0,"ok . first things first , this is the location near my friends apartment and i go to starbucks almost everyday . i walk in to the lobby the first day and i ordered a breakfast sandwich and somehow they gave me a lemon loaf cake which they were annoyed to exchange even though i had my receipt in hand , and i also ordered a iced white mocha . the girl on the register was obviously new and confused and it took her a really long time to get everything in the system and the manager on duty was obviously annoyed with her asking for help . the second time i went to this location i used the drive thru thinking it would be better , my friend got a black coffee and i got an iced coffee figuring this order was a lot harder to mess up . . . . wrong . my iced coffee didn t have wm sweetener like i asked it had classic syrup and cream instead . and to make matters worse . . . i am an employee of starbucks . i gave the girl my employee numbers and she said wow you are a dinosaur umm thanks ? ! it has the potential to be a good location but far from it now .

0,"i went to this store and ordered over in chicken and sides to take home . when we got home , we discovered that the extra biscuits that i paid extra for , were not included in the bag . we ate the rest of the meal , and near the end of the meal , my daughter bit into her chicken strip , felt something hard , and pulled a small stud earring out of her mouth . i went back to the restaurant a few minutes later and explained the situation to the person at the counter . she said that i needed to talk to her coach i could not understand what she was saying , and asked her to repeat herself a couple of times . i still could not figure out what kind of coach she was talking about . i asked to speak to her manager and was told her coach was the manager and that i would need to call her after pm because she was busy . i reminded the person behind the counter that i too was busy and did not like having to come down to the store again because an earring from someone s body was found in my food . n ni contacted the coach after pm and was told that she would open a claim into the incident . i asked for a refund for our food and the woman told me that she would not give me my money back . she said that i would have to return all the food back to the store . i told her the rest of the meal was eaten by my family and asked which end she wanted it out of ! she said that she would give me a store credit for the biscuits that were missing from my order . so , the only restitution for finding a foreign object in the food is a store credit to go back and eat their food again . n ni contacted the health district . i have also been in contact with the insurance company regarding the investigation . this incident is ongoing . n nwhen we told a friend about this incident , they knew exactly which kfc we had this horrible experience in , even before we told them where it was . they had a bad experience there too .

0,"my family comes here off and on since it is near by and pretty cheap . we decided to come in for a family breakfast and while it is cheap , the food is terrible . the eggs tasted more like those liquid ones that are over done , their bacon strips are like thin sticks that were pretty tasteless , and their biscuits were hard like they were stale . my brother in law said their eggs were terrible , but i figured that it was just a bad experience for him . . . but nope they were bad , but were bad in a different way than he explained too runny for him . . . mine were hard and could even choke them down . n nthe server was slow , and only listened to half of what we requested , never dropped off syrup for my sister s order . . . took us getting up and asking someone behind the counter for the syrup and tabasco sauce . she didn t come around to refill drinks nearly as often as i had hoped either . the place wasn t busy enough to warrant the neglect we received , but i am sure a regular would disagree . n ni will not come back here for breakfast at least . . . but with other places nearby i could choose from , this is the bottom of my return list .

0,have been using this service for a month . each weekend my family would go out to use the pool the floor of the pool would not be clean and would be cloudy if used . having a party planned for this weekend so i called to simply ask if it could be for sure cleaned up for the weekend and i was given major attitude . not once was i rude to this guy and he snapped at me for no reason . he stated he doesn t like to be told he is not doing his job and that he would terminate my service so i could find someone who could clean my pool . i would not recommend anyone use his service due to his bad attitude and bad service .

0,"okay , stayed here mon . , oct . st fri . , oct . th . omg ! what a nightmare ! i will never stay here until renovations are done . there is two major pros . . . price it s so cheap ! and location , location , location . seriously , you re dab smack in the middle of the strip . half my stay was on my boss dime and the other half was comped because i have a players card . bear in mind that this used to be the old imperial palace until caesar properties bought it . it s like the forgotten child of all their hotels . n nmon . , october st i checked in really late because i had a late flight into vegas . for late check in , that was sure a long line . around pm ish i begin the check in process , when i asked the lady at the front desk helping me . . . what kind of room did my boss book me in ? she replies classic . eww , i know that means the cheap room ! my players card for my half had me for a deluxe room . she then proceeds to tell me that they also don t have anymore non smoking rooms that are classic unless i wanna upgrade to deluxe which is more per night . seriously , imagine if i was asthmatic ! i declined because i still had to pay for the resort fees night for two nights and said that i ll deal with the smoking room and change to a non smoking , if i needed to . that s not the bad part yet ! first of all i couldn t find the room ! i went around and around looking for lower level elevators . management you need to provide maps ! it took me more than mins to try to find it and then i found a house phone and they sent security to where i was because the room is below the casino level . yah , that is weird ! when i get to the room , it looked like the s d u e cor threw up in there and stayed there . i would ve taken a picture but i was so horrified i wasn t thinking . stained carpeting , ugly stained wall paper , and dingy yellow bathroom . i didn t smell like cigarette smoke until i turned on the air conditioning and was disgusted . i turned off the ac and then bolted for upstairs . n ntues , october nd past am . i told them to just upgrade me because i didn t want to deal with a smoking room anymore . i told her it was nasty ! she tells me they no longer have king sized beds , just queens . roll my eyes she tells me that i can exchange the room tomorrow . ugh ! fine ! so she puts me on the th floor . i enter my room which is so much more easier to find and was happy with what i saw until through investigation . it freaked the hell out of me that my balcony door was wide open . i slowly approached with my purse in case i needed to clobber someone . now here s another thing that sucked . . . the sliding door would not close . i pulled , pushed , and tried to lift the door . ugh ! i had to call down stairs and they had to send maintenance up . finally after mins someone shows up and finally gets my door closed . trust me at this point i m still not happy but the room was a lot more better than the basement . lol n nin the morning , i went to the gym since it came with my resort fee . i also didn t really unpack my stuff because i had the intention of changing rooms . after my endorphins were up , i had breakfast at hash house a go go and vented my troubles to a coworker who apparently didn t have the as much trouble as me . his girlfriend did agree that the carpet in the rooms were icky and the place was really outdated . around pm i packed up my stuff , left my luggage in my room , and went downstairs to change my room . omg ! that check in line is ridiculous until . . . i spied a glimmer of hope . what ? ! ? ! there s a check in line for gold card player members ? ! ? ! that s me ! omg ! and there s not a single person in line . thank god ! i explain my whole story and the situation , the woman sympathizes with me . i ask her is there any way to just combine my reservations so i don t have to move half way thorough my stay and she does it . btw , she told me they are not going to start any room renovations until january . what ? ! ? ! yah , crazy ! on top of that . . . i didn t pay anymore resort fees for the rest of my stay and she credited the i spent upgrading my room . she put me on the th floor . . . yup it s below penthouse . not bad ! i got everything i wanted for the most part in a room . after all the moves , my only complaint was the bed wasn t as fluffy with a down comforter like my th floor bed . oh well ! n nwed . , oct rd fri . , oct th another complaint . i don t think there are enough maids there . or they just don t know which rooms are being used because i had to call housekeeping each day to come clean my room . n nwould i stay here again ? only in desperation . there are so many other hotels to stay at the same price but in my situation i didn t have a car like i normally do so this location is ideal if you don t have one . walking everywhere and taking the deuce bus was easy ! hmm . . . re review maybe . . . late ! lol"

0,"i would never go back ! n nour visit started with a group of bellman who ignored us when we pulled up to park our car at the valet . we had to call out to a group of chatting bellman for help . no sooner did the bellman start removing our bags from the trunk when someone in charge of valet parking started yelling at us to move our car . it was unbelievable . the bellman was embarrassed but said this is just how they are . my husband got back in the car to reposition it and stop the yelling . n nwe went in to the lobby and faced as line of at least trying to check in . they did not have enough people working to handle the crowd . n nwe paid for a high end room with panoramic views . but unlike most better hotels , the bellman did not accompany us to our room . when we got there we could not figure out how to operate the many electric operated blinds and light switches . ordinarily , the bellman shows you to your room and shows you how to use its features . n nwe quickly discovered the room was poorly cleaned . there was dust on virtually every surface and a large coffee drip under the coffee maker on the counter . there were greasy fingerprints on the cabinets and tv . there were hunks of fallen snacks just under the couch . someone s forgotten beach shawl was in the closet . again , it was unbelievable . n nwe had theatre tickets and needed to change and rush out , so we had no time to demand a new room . the next morning we needed to check out early and tried to use the advertised check out service on the tv screen , but it did not work . the service said the front desk was too busy so we needed to check out in person . but when my husband went downstairs , there were no guests at the front desk . just employees waiting around . to top it all off , when we called from our room for the valet to bring the car around , we were told that they won t do that . we needed to come down and wait . n nthis place holds itself out and charges high end prices , but the service is appalling and the dirty room was creepy . yes this place has a great view , but it is not worth the money . skip it ! ! the one star i gave vdara is for the view nothing more .

0,"i really hate to bump this place down to two stars but i must . i brought in seven pairs of my husbands pants to be cleaned . we have used this dry cleaner for a year with zero issues . when i got home , i noticed a few pairs were pressed incorrectly so the pants had two pleats down the front . they were nice about it when i brought them back in and said it would be no charge to fix them . so , i dropped off and picked up again and the same thing happened again with two pairs ! i am very disappointed with this place which is unfortunate because everyone is so pleasant each time i come . i will be looking for a new dry cleaner .

0,"friendly staff and convenient location halfway between our friends new house and ours . awful food . our friends just moved and after helping them rearrange furniture , we needed to find some food quickly . wanting to support this recently opened , non chain restaurant , we agreed to try it despite my italian skepticism at any restaurant that misspells buona in its name ! nlike nicolas m , i too am italian . i traveled across italy and sampled the bounty of small town italy , feasting at my cousin s home in molise . i appreciate great food , but also want to see the small business owner succeed and applaud anyone who has the chutzpah to open a restaurant in this still crappy economy . nour non italian friends were here before and said it was ok i know , with that glowing endorsement , why didn t i steer them elsewhere ? . nwe entered on a saturday just before pm . we were the only patrons ! we ve dined out several times with our friends and their yr old son . this is the first time i ve seen the boy so spooked at a restaurant . maybe he was having the godfather flashbacks or just didn t know what to make of a restaurant with no other customer ? ! this is a great kid who is normally well behaved in restaurants , but here , he was nervous and on the verge of tears for about minutes ! nthere was a man and a woman possibly the owners and then a chef . after her first visit , my friend said she thought they were speaking italian . however , i quickly confirmed they were speaking spanish not that there s anything wrong w that but i wouldn t be confident at a chinese restaurant to hear the staff speaking polish ! i really really wanted to ask them what region they were from in italy , but my husband made me keep princess snarkella locked up . nthey brought a basket of mediocre garlic bread . it was nicely garlicky , but had a fresh from the costco freezer texture . sad to admit , but we ate it , so they brought us another basket , which was overcooked and not as garlicky as the first batch . really ? ? with only table , is it that hard to achieve a little consistency with the bread ? ! ? ! ? ! nwe perused the overly crowded and confusing menu . confusing because of the many spelling errors and typos , as well as the feline or brown sauce mentioned by nicolas m . what the heck is feline sauce ? ! ? ! ? i googled to see if it was misspelled , trying such variations as fellini or felini but found nothing . needless to say , if you re going to misspell or misname a sauce , you might want to avoid any connotations that conjure up family pets . nalso strange was the way the man presented the daily specials . he came to our table with plates wrapped in plastic wrap , featuring the actual food items that they probably would have put flame to had we chosen one of the specials . again , too many choices . is it really necessary to offer daily specials at a small cafe ? they would be better off following in the steps of the fabulous postino by choosing to focus on a few menu items while preserving the utmost quality , rather than a landslide of meh options . nmy pasta genova was probably the best at the table , a creamy pesto sauce with linguine . the sauce had an ok flavor , but the pine nuts were like a rainbow . . . . some very light , some a nicely toasted golden color , some a darker brown and a few overcooked to a deep chocolaty hue . my husband ordered some creamy type sauce with peas and pancetta over penne . it was flat . our friend s chicken with red sauce was abominable . i think i would rather have ragu ! ! the only item i didn t try was my friend s husband s lasagna . nalthough they have no liquor license yet , they do have a very reasonable . corkage fee , and had i realized this policy , i would have happily grabbed a bottle or two of seghesio zinfandel at the safeway . ndessert tray was impressive looking and our friends son adored their chocolate cheesecake type selection , but we were again meh about our creme brulee type dish . nplease la buona pasta , check your spellings consult an italian english dictionary , pick up a lidia bastianich cookbook , hell , even visit a macaroni grill , at least they have proof readers . and cut the menu options by at least . find a few items you can perfect and stick with those . less is best . any good italian knows the most delicious food consists of a few top quality ingredients simply prepared with love nbuona fortuna ! .

0,"my friend ordered chicken nuggets , and two of them were molded together . i m vegetarian , so i sat there with my crappy fries but tasty frosty and watched the madness unfold . n nas she tore the two melded nuggets away from each other , there was a gelly white paste that dripped out . i am literally gagging just recalling the incident , and i almost threw up all over the table . n nthis exact same scenario happened to my sister , on her totally different box of chicken nuggets second later . nobody finished our food . we all just left . n nthere is white gooey crap in the food at wendys . n nso incredibly gross . so gross . gross . don t go here , for the love of god ! !

0,"a group of of us went here for dinner a few of our party had eaten here a few years ago and wanted to go back . n ni shared the porterhouse with my wife , i think other orders were ribeye prime rib . n nthe entrees come with either a salad or soup and a baked potato , sweet potato or mash . n nthe salad looked like something you could pour out of prepackaged salad from the grocery store . we asked for ranch on the side , but got blue cheese instead . n nour entrees seemed to take a long time to arrive we were the second table sat in the restaurant as it opened . n nthe porterhouse didn t look anything like the oz it was quoted as on the menu if i had a scale with me i would have weighed it ! it was cold and most shockingly of all it had absolutely no seasoning on it , at all , nothing . n nthe sweet potato was cooked to almost a mush baby food consistency . n nwe were eating with friends who had suggested we go here and so i didn t want to make a scene and send the food back but if we had been there in a smaller group i would for sure have sent the food back , it really just wasn t good at all . n nafter the meal we spoke with or of the other diners and they also said that they were unimpressed with their food and will not return . n ni am told this place , when it its old location , was great on the strength of my food i just cannot say that .

0,"just returned from full circle car wash and i am very disappointed . this is the second bad car wash i have had in the past two weeks . the outside is dirty and has water spots and the inside never got wiped down even though i paid for it . for , i would expect a clean vehicle . "
0,"the best part of the meal was our server , she was friendly and attentive . the food was pathetic . ordered potato skins and each one had a few crumbs of bacon and a pinch of cheese , about the size of a quarter on each . my friend ordered the spinach dip and it was good , but i was still disappointed looking at my potato skins sitting there so lonely and naked . . . sat near the window , big mistake , it was so hot !

0,"for a coffee shop , they really don t serve very good coffee . all of the coffee and espresso drinks that i ve gotten there have been disappointing the coffee was lukewarm , there were coffee or espresso grounds in the drink itself , etc . n nthe service was quite slow the last time i was there , and i was the only person in line . the few times that i ve been , the staff has always had a holier than thou attitude . what about , i m not sure , exactly , but so it goes .

0,"last night i had the worst experience at this whole foods , and unfortunately it happened right after a very nice experience with a sweet , patient , and knowledgeable young lady at the cheese counter . thank you naomi for you kindness and your spot on cheese suggestions ! n nas for at least one member of their management team , i can truly say she seriously lacks in the customer service area ! this is what happened . as i passed by the registers i noticed one of their signature black sample tables . on it was an open clam shell container with cookies inside . i grabbed a cookie and proceeded to go to the produce section . a few minutes later i was finally ready to check out . as i was placing my items on the conveyor belt , a short woman with short brown curly hair and black glasses about feet from me began to yell . i looked up to see what the commotion was about and realized she was yelling at me . ma am . . . ma am , just so you know she exclaimed bitterly , those cookies were not samples ! i was so shocked and at that point everyone within earshot was staring at us . i said i was sorry and i offered to pay for the cookies , and she retorted nastily with if you want to . the bag girl looked horrified and i was thoroughly humiliated . at least the cashier realized i made an honest mistake i found out later that i wasn t the first one to make it and tried to redeem their store s reputation by reassuring me it was ok . however she didn t appear to be surprised by this woman s ridiculous and senseless behavior . i wonder if she makes a habit of berating customers and her employees ? a customer from the other side of the next register actually came around to offer me comfort after this vicious verbal assault . n nin taking the cookie i made a blunder but i already had over worth of groceries in my cart , it wasn t like i was trying to get away with some kind of cookie heist . this manager should have handled this situation in a more professional manner . she should have approached me in a kind and informative manner smile preferred and brought the error to my attention in a normal conversational volume . it is bad business to publicly and uproariously mortify paying customers ! n nbottom line , i will not ever return to this store !

0,"very interesting experience went there since it s close to where i m visiting . n ntwo people enrtered chen s before i did and were perusing the menu so i did too ! n nthere were no combo s in the evening and i was not impressed with the look of the place nor the prices on the menu . n nthe people ahead of me handed the menu back and left and seeing the sullen reaction of the manager , so did i .

0,"stopped by on a thursday with the bf trying to bring back old memories from when we were kids touring this chocolate factory . it is much smaller than i remember and on the day we went , nobody was working . so that was a wasted trip . the lady said usually there are people working in the factory monday thursday a to about pm . we stopped by around p and . . . nobody working . n nof course the store was still open and the chocolates here are so yummy ! toured the cactus garden and then left , nothing special . was really bummed .

0,"no . just , no . n ni ve been back several times and i just keep being disappointed . the manager and staff , as jen has mentioned , are rude beyond believe . n nthey ll rudely tell you to sit down , as there s table service , but they won t actually come and take your order for quite some time . also , the place stinks . i m sorry , there is a very persistent and bad smell that lingers . it s been quite noticeable on my last three visits and as a result i haven t been since . n ndon t get me wrong , the food is lovely , the cocktail i had was marvelous , but the rudeness of the staff , the smell , and just the way you re treated means that i won t be back in until this place changes owners . n nno way , no how .

0,"please indicate if the following points are true or false n n you and matt were really excited to visit true food kitchen during restaurant week . true n n upon arrival , the two of you were happy to be seated promptly without a reservation . true n n the cheerful restaurant d u e cor infused you with organic , healthy , and sustainable vibes . true n n you and matt really enjoyed sitting outdoors on the cozy patio that was artistically bordered with green grass . true n n the menu s variety of healthy and fresh options initially looked impressive and yummy . true n n it took your waiter about minutes to acknowledge your existence after being seated , even though the restaurant wasn t very crowded . true n n when the waiter finally arrived , he didn t welcome you to the restaurant , introduce himself or even explain the concept behind the menu that dr . weil mr . fox created . instead he looked bored and just wanted to know your order . true n n waiters at applebee s have made a better first impression than he did . true n n the seasoned hummus appetizer , topped with a flavorful mediterranean mix of kalamata olives , cucumbers , feta and sliced pearl tomatoes impressed both of you . however the amount of time it took this dish to make its way to your table did not . true n n it seemed like the entire restaurant staff was playing a game of guess who ? waiters kept moronically walking around with food , stopping at different tables and trying to guess who ordered what . true n n at least times it occurred so frequently you stopped counting , a random waiter placed someone else s food in front of you , and you had to tell them that they guessed wrong . true n n you ordered a salad , tofu teriyaki bowl and frozen yogurt with berries . matt ordered the smoked salmon , steak tacos and flourless chocolate cake . it was healthy , fresh and good but definitely not worth the bill including a bottle of wine . true n n you both felt robbed . a much more pleasant , faster and cheaper alternative would have been to buy the wine and ingredients from trader joes or whole foods and prepare this simple meal yourselves . true n n a snail could have cooked and served your simple meal faster then the painstaking hours it took your waiter . true n n the restaurant s parking validation is only good for two free hours in the lot but the wait staff decided to play that irritating game of guess who ? and couldn t serve your simple meal in less than two hours so to top it all off , you still had to pay for parking , which was beyond upsetting after so many other let downs . true n n although you liked the d u e cor and really wanted to love this restaurant , you don t recommend it to anyone since you have most certainly tasted much better health food . true n nthank you for your responses to these true food kitchen statements . we are excited for when you return to enjoy more of our overpriced food and overwhelmingly bad service . false ! ! !

0,"salsa is good . food is hit or miss , but sadly all the reviews about the service and the long waits and the nazi rule about not seating your party are all true . it looks nice , but the experience leaves such a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of salsa can cover it up . "
0,"had a late check in and instead of the room that i booked , we were put in an upgraded room which was a downgrade in my opinion . as if this weren t enough reason to be irritated , the carpets and walls were thrashed and had looked like they had never been cleaned . complained but no one cared . will never stay at mgm again . plenty of other great hotels in vegas .

0,"we have been here twice with a large family and we have had mixed experiences which led me to a lot of trouble with reviewing this restaurant . n nfirst of all , lets talk about the ambiance because that is the reason you show up . the view is spectacular . the magician that shows up at the table is amusing and fun kids love it . now the slide . first time we showed up a year ago , my kids , and slid happily for an hour . the second time there were new rules and a mean woman that yelled at my pound daughter and made her cry yes , i carried a child out of the rooste crying . n nfood . well , its pretty bad very fried . the side salad and biscuit were decent . everything that followed was overpriced and nasty . first of all , i had kids that didn t want the normal hot dog and chicken fingers kid s meal so i had to pay for a meal share for each of them really ? ? ? ? . the steak was not good . the kid s spaghetti was sent back and the butter noodles that replaced it were welcomed . n nthey couldn t bring us the check quick enough and we are done with our annual trip there . "
0,"my experience has been awful ! i had to come here because of treatment in progress and the other office unexpectedly closed . the offices communication is not great . they made me wait for an appoint and then i sat for hours because they could not get my information from the office that closed . the final topper is they sent me to collections due to discrepancy between prior dentist payments and theirs . i tried to call and resolve once i saw they destroyed my perfect credit , but they still wouldn t remove . beware they will ruin your life and your credit ! ! ! ! !

0," this is specifically for the service department n ni purchased a odyssey touring from this dealer and the next day we unfortunately ran into a chunk of old tire on the i freeway . the damage to the vehicle seemed to only be a non functioning fog lamp and parking sensor . we took the van back to the dealer and they had it for a whole day to investigate what it needed to get fully repaired . nhere s where it gets deceitful , i received a call from the service department saying there was extensive damage and the warranty along with the bumper to bumper warranty we purchased did not cover the damages . the amount to fix was going to be and that was giving us a deal . i said no thank you and decided to take a look myself . ni brought the van home , elevated the front end , removed two screws and found that all i needed to do was plug the fog light back in and purchase a new clip to hold the parking sensor in . this tells me that the service department didn t even look at the van ! they just threw a number out there and hoped that i would take the bait and pay for a part . n nmake sure you know who you are trying to scam , not everyone is naive .

0,"this is a very sad moment for me , because this is the first one star i have given to any restaurant . however , as sad as it is , it can not be avoided . my boyfriend and i have been coming to this buca di beppo for a while now , and every time we come the service gets progressively worse . yesterday , he decided to take me out as a surprise dinner date . n nupon arriving , we were seated the the waitress came to our table to take our order . we ordered our drinks and ordered the pasta that we love so much , the penne arrabiata . after we ordered the waitress gave us an attitude and look as if saying , is that really all you re going to order ? we just smiled at her politely , and eventually she went to put our order in . although it did seem kind of rude , we just brushed it off because they were pretty busy that day . n none of the things we love most about buca is the bread . after placing our order , we waited patiently for our bread . sadly , it never came . we saw that same waitress bring bread and attend to everyone else s table but out own . the only time she came by our table was to bring out our actual meal . the penne arrabiata was good as always , but sadly not even that can make me give this place any higher of a rating . n nbesides the lack of bread , our cups of water needed to be refilled and not once did she come by to check on us . i even made eye contact with her a few times and tried to get her attention , but she never stopped by our table to check on anything . my boyfriend , who was at the edge of the booth even drank all of his water and placed it at the edge of the table to see if anyone would notice , but no one did . n nsadly , the dinner at buca was definitely one of the worst dining experiences i ve had in a long time . i will just have to find a new one to go to .

0,"i just want to update in response to the owners note . this in fact is a legit review , i visited the spa in march and had this exact experience and if your records do not reflect that you have yet another issue . n njust as a lesson i would encourage you to reach out and try to answer issues politely , all in all this isn t a horrible review , i likely would have given it another chance . now though you ve made the matter worse and my decision will never change and i will absolutely not be returning . n none last update , if i m not in your system why did you email me a birthday special this month ? oh and this is after i ve opted out of your mailing list . n nall around bad business happening at this place . avoid !

0,"my problem is not with the pet supplies or the quality food they carry , it was with the groomer . my golden was brought in for a bath and brush and came home with clipper burn and open sores on his behind . he was matted there from swimming in the pool and i consented to shaving his hindquarters shaved . when i explained how i felt when i saw my dog and his obvious discomfort with the groomer there was no empathy , no apology and no culpability . she didn t even put anything on the affected areas to soothe his discomfort before she sent him home . she will get no return business from me and no referrals ever . the owner did however refund my money when i asked for a refund . she did apologize for the incident .

0,"hot deli services review only ! n ni really hate how disorganized the hot deli service is at . there no sign that tells you where the line is for ordering paying . there are times when i just walk up to the cashier and order . so , i decided to get in the same line to place an order and when i reached the front , the cashier girl tells me to get out of line and get in another line to order the food . wtf ! i don t understand why she can t just pick a few items to the left of her that i needed . it was really pointless to get out of that line when , what i needed was right next to her . all i know is that i will never order food from that place ever again ! ! ! ! !

0,"what a horrible experience ! never ever will i stay at mandalay bay ever ! my family and i spent after xmas holiday at this hotel , when we got to our room . it smelled like vomit ! so gross ! we went back to the lobby and complained about it , they told us there was no other room available . . we got tired of pushing we need another room and getting the same answer and since we were very tired from a long drive , we were forced to sleep in a room that smells like vomit ! did not even offer to send a cleaning crew housekeeper or whatever to spray the room , not even an offer to upgrade the room or a buffet voucher , nothing ! we paid over a in a supposedly luxury hotel expecting a luxury service to sleep in a room smelling like vomit ! what a horrible experience . oh by the way , we re going bck to vegas for a day vacation , but not in mandalay bay ! never ever again .

0,food was pretty good but read the menu carefully because there s some interesting little surprises such as pomegranate seeds in the guacamole . unique . . . sure . . . but it made me feel like a picky little kid pet peeve of mine btw . the posole was really amazing but the place gets stars because the service was unbelievably s l o w . there were only parties including us in the place and we still didn t see the waitress for way too long . at one point i had to get up to go find her . plus . . . i overheard her giving much better explanations about hh pricing and menu options to other tables . would have appreciated hearing that info before ordering . noverralll . . . not coming back . 
0,"bagels are one of those cultural things people hold on to no matter if bagels are good or bad people will say they are the best in mtl and they convince themselves of the awesomeness . n ni am impartial to bagels and i am not from montreal . i am completely objective in saying that the bagels here are good . . . but so are per cent of other places that make bagels . n nthe major factor playing a role in what makes this bagel different if you can notice at all is the the fact that you can grab it straight out of oven unlike starbucks or tim hortons which have to be delivered and reheated . n nin conclusion , if this is the best that bagels can be i would say it s worth a go just to say you ve been there , done that but don t expect something you ve never experienced before . especially if you have it built up in your mind that you re face is going to explode with deliciousness like i had . "
0,food is pretty good . i do enjoy their country style steak . but it s only available certain nights . the past few times we have been we have had this waitress that just made the whole experience awful . she makes fun of anything we say or do . she does it so loud that other customers stare . she rushes us to order and then rushes us out the door when we are done . she may think she s joking funny but she s very rude and embarrassing . won t be returning for a while that s for sure
0,"i didn t have a waiter the entire time that i was here . i kept dealing with the bus boy to get things done , and he barely spoke english . no one seemed to care about the customers , and everyone was busy chatting with each other to even give us a refill of water . i will never eat here again . that being said , the food was alright , but there are much , much better places to dine at . don t give your money to this place .

0,"i ve been to other bravo locations before and have had wonderful experiences . i m not sure what s going on with this charlotte location . . . n n . i was told they were out of caesar salad . what italian restaurant runs out of caesar salad ? ! n n . my entree was good , but rather salty . n n . our waiter basically ignored us the entire time . i spent much of the dinner trying to figure out if he was just new or confused as to what his job description entailed . he seemed to have no problem checking on his other tables . n n . it took literally forever for our drinks to arrive . i don t care how busy you are it doesn t take minutes to bring me a beer that s not even on draft ! n n . i don t normally care how long it takes to clear plates off a table but when the entree plates are crammed into the corner of the tiny table while i m trying to eat dessert i have a problem .

0,"no chips and salsa ? what ! ? ! ? what ? ! ? ! n nseriously . . . i can t think of another mexican restaurant in the area that doesn t offer free chips and salsa . . . . n nwe ordered food for the of us adults and children which consisted of chimichangas , tacos for my wife , and kids meals . with drinks , our bill came to and change . this place is definitely more expensive than most mexican restaurants in the area . the waiter didn t give me ice in my water , which made it very tepid . the service was slow as well . i don t know why everyone is rating this place so well . i m used to getting free chips and salsa at mexican restaurants , especially for for people . we definitely won t be back here . "
0,"i do not understand why this place gets such good reviews . first , i live down the street from smiling banana leaf , so i ve had the dubious pleasure of going there more than once . each time , i go and hope it ll be better but it never is . n nfirst the chicken is pre cooked before it s inserted into whatever curry you order . why hasn t anyone else realized this ? it s always gummy , and sometimes it s downright odd tasting . in fact , if you look through the kitchen doorway on the way in , you can see the big bin of pre cooked chicken . n nthat s if you manage to find the chicken in your selected curry at all . last time i was there , i ordered the mussaman curry . as some other reviewer pointed out , it had crinkle cut carrots in it . i ordered the extra chicken . the extra chicken tasted odd , but at least it was on the plate . the time before that , i got the green curry and it came with possibly eight pieces of thin chicken bits . n nanother time , i ordered the pad thai . pad thai , i thought , hard to f k that up . it came in a nondescript brown sauce , no vegetables , very little tofu , and black bits stuck to the egg in the noodles . n nthe pad see ew is ok if you re hungry , but feels somewhat one dimensional . n nand then there s the issue of their fried dumplings . who sticks these things in a deep fryer ? the last time i had them , they were unpleasantly crispy and overly oily . n nanyway , i m posting this because i can t for the life of me understand why this place is rated so highly . it s mediocre at best . seriously . "
0,"food is overpriced and not very good . atmosphere is cafeteria like . the salad and wine were down right horrible . the garlic bread was bland and tasteless . the waitstaff was rude and unfriendly . the cook was chewing gum while cooking and prepping food . we will never go here again . n non a positive note , the food was served quickly . "
0,"the reason for stars . order accuracy ! my food has been wrong the last times ! i ordered quesa tacos for my lady and me . we ordered shrimp and carnitas . we got beef and carnitas . the server said the ticket was correct . this is the third time this happened ! don t get me wrong , the food is great but you also should get what you order the first time . "
0,"i thought this place was alright . if someone wanted to check it out i would go back but i wouldn t recommend it when picking a place to eat . the menu is kind of small and there is really only sushi which is fine but if you have a non sushi eating person in the group this place would not work . nwe went here on a sunday afternoon at noonish and stayed for quite awhile . . . . no one else came in while we were there . this sort of freaked me out . anyway the sashimi and sushi were fine . nothing amazing but not bad at all . the one thing i did not like was the spicy tuna roll was pretty big . i can t stand that . anyway , its ok . check it out and decide for yourself . "
0,"i know , i know , my last review says i won t be back . this time i mean it . i was persuaded by a friend and succumbed to the pressure . n ni ll get this out of the way , the service was fine . nothing to complain about . even though we complained about of the meals we had they handled it with professionalism . n ni had the turkey burger , which sounds great on the menu . it was bland , flavorless and had way too much bread . in the industry they call this bun coverage and this freaking burger didn t come close to covering the footprint of the bun . the people they have cooking in the back obviously don t know how to check a burger for doneness since there was a big hunk taken out of the burger where they hacked it with their spatula . n nmy buddy ordered the steak wrap whatever it s called on the menu and it was served burrito style note there s a difference between a burrito and a wrap with so much rice in it and virtually no steak . for like . he complained and they fixed it . n nmy sweet , innocent baby girl who only eats pizza and french fries shared my way too salty french fries that were served with my burger and had to order a flatbread off the menu for . which had a big hair in it when it was served . since we complained about the wrap the manager came over and said yeah , the waitress said there was a problem and asked me to come over ? we told him the deal on the pizza and he asked did you send it back ? and when we responded he just walked away . that s it , no apology or anything . so , we ordered a cheese flatbread with nothing else for a kid were charged full price and got an extra hair in our serving ? the people that own this place are professionals right ? what the heck ? train your managers how to handle issues when they come up . n nplus the outside dining area was unkempt and very dirty . french fries and food debris were all over the place . n nflavorless , overpriced , but packed . i think people want this type of restaurant , but big view imo doesn t execute well at all .

0,i give it over all two stars . we went in and this place is a ghost town inside and i now know why . i did provide pictures . nthe pizza is cold pre made just waiting to be recooked . the spaghetti and everything noodle is over cooked and dried out . lord don t get me started on people in the united states who cant speak english . these people have to say everything times because their english is so broken and bad . nthe bread is dried out and just sad they just decided to just butter up or oil up hard cold bread . i just threw my hands up and didnt even ask for a refund because truth is odds are they was not gonna be able to understand me . because they dont speak english well . ni asked for water as always the water cup was so tiny it was like a sad prank . its like am i going to brush my teeth or drink water with a meal . if i can spend bucks to eat then they should be able to give me water . 
0,"all i wanted was a faded madmen style cut . i just moved here and have been desperately looking for someone who could do that . didn t realize it would be that tough . n nthe receptionist recommended and booked me someone so i went with it . n ni should have ran for my life when i saw her using both hands on the clippers . she kept reassuring me that she would blend it . nthat never happened . n nlesson learned , at the end of it all at least my partner got a good laugh out of it . n ni m sure there are plenty of good stylist there but i m just gonna try another shop .

0,"ok . . . i know i am not the st guy to say it , and won t be the last i m sure as well , but i don t go to strip clubs often . i haven t been to a strip club in sometime , so when i was invited to a friend s birthday party at d u e j u e vu showgirls . i had been to their store and thought it was nice , clean and tasteful . . . well as tasteful as an adult emporium can be that is . i really thought sure . . . why not ? i had never been to the strip club attached to it , but if the store was any indication it would be a decent place . n n ! ! ! spoiler alert ! ! ! the strip club is nothing like the store ! granted i didn t think the club would be well lite like the store , but it is nothing like the store . when my friend and i met there we were both in complete shock at the condition of the place . not only did the wave of second hand smoke smack us in the face , but it almost obscured the view of the entertainers . now with that said , after seeing the vast majority of the entertainers . . . i m ok with the smoke screen . don t get me wrong . . . i m not saying i m all that , but if i m going to go to a strip club to see strippers . . . i want to see above average to hot women who take care of themselves . i honestly didn t see a singled entertainer there that i would have found attractive on the street if we meet , long enough one i would pay my hard earned money for a lap dance . n nonce the smoke cleared , or i get used to it , i noticed the booth i was sitting at was dirty , stained and had cigarette burns all over it . my friend and i then moved a little closer to the stage and sat at a table and chairs . the chairs were in no better shape , but the table was stained and sticky as well . i realize it isn t going to be restaurant clean , but this was worse than most truck stop quality strip clubs i ve had the misfortune of visiting over the years . n nmy suggestions to others is avoid this place unless you enjoy smoke , overpriced weak drinks , not so attractive entertainers , dirty sticky furniture and the need to see free hats being given away with each lap dance . however , if you do go my advice is drink heavy before you get there , leave your glasses at home and spend as much time in the store as possible . oh . . . and don t forget to get your tetanus shot afterwards . . . just in case .

0,"fraudulently charged ! ngot ripped off , ordered over the phone , guy tells me dollars , with tax and delivery charge , came out to dollars , ok i m fine with dollars for a delivered pizza . anyways days later i go to check my debit card , and notice a dollar charge to it . surely enough it was because of ordering their pizza . what a fraudulent place , never ever will i order from these dirt bags again , and also will let the authorities know .

0,"not a huge fan . i went mostly for the boba tea eager to try something beyond evo but had to eat as well . i knew there wouldn t be much for me as a non beef eater pho is out but the shrimp spring rolls were pretty good . not so satisfied with the green tea boba i ordered . it wasn t slushy which is okay but the flavor was not as bitter as i was expecting from green tea and i just didn t like it . so i tried again and got an almond tea , which was more to my liking . flavors seemed a bit hit and miss my friend s spiced chai was pretty good , but red bean , not so much so i wouldn t really be willing to go and explore more flavors in case i get more misses . on the plus side , the boba itself the tapioca balls were smaller , chewier , and overall much more pleasant to eat than the boba at evo . n nthe staff was also very nice and friendly so points to that .

0,"would not recommend this salon ever . what happened to salon stylists looking and presenting themselves amazingly . most stylists now days dress like crap and their hair looking undone and sloppy . these ladies were nice but very sloppy and the work done on my hair was ehhhh , soso . nothing to brag about . whats worse is that the set up of the salon , with no receptionists is so weird and awkward . nthe girls doing my hair was sweet but the stylist next to her decided to tell me that she didn t like my hair cut , meaning the way it was cut . almost making fun of me . my theory is , if your going to make that comment , your going to follow up with a let me fix it for you . otherwise it comes off insulting . . . . . . duhh wouldn t you want my business . this comment isn t wanting my to come back and get further servcies . then she says sorry we keep it real here , this isnt professional , its not about keeping it real lady . nwhat happen to good service from professional people , with hair and style that make me want to get my hair cut from . . . . ? someone please tell me .

0,"i work in the office park where this place is located . i will eat there only out of desperation . in fact , this past friday , i was short on time and skipped lunch rather than going there . their food is mediocre at best . i think it changed hands in the spring of and since then , portions are smaller , prices are higher , and i think the woman who appears to be the owner is irritating . they charge you to pay with a debit credit card . also , their ventilation is not good , so you will leave there smelling like fried food . n nthe old owners were very nice people and very fair . my only complaint with them was that the coffee was douwe egberts and was terrible .

0,"this was very disappointing . n ni had read the reviews and people were raving about it . plus , it was cheap . n ni shouldn t have listened . n nupon arrival , the buffet looked very nice . it was packed , the decor was nice , and it smelled fine . n nbut then i started eating . n nthe food was alright , definitely not the best but not the worst . n ni tried the sopes , turkey , mussels , various salads , eggs benedict , and so on . n nnothing memorable , really . n nand who puts warm plates on the salad line ? n nthe food was average . i wouldn t recommend it . "
0,"i m always up for buffets around mesa , az and trust me i ve eaten at some really good ones and some really bad ones . unfortunately for me and my husband , this one was bad , really really bad . the sushi was terrible and tasteless . the tuna tasted like it had been sitting in the refrigerator for a few days not a few hours . n ni gave up on their sushi after i tasted the tuna . then i went to some of the standard and some not so standard buffet food . all of it was tasteless gelatin globs of yuck . will i go back no . why not because i honestly don t want to be sick the next day , which is what i m hoping doesn t happen now . n nhubby , didn t do any better with his dinner either . he loves chinese food and all it has to offer and you know somethings up when he leaves a lot of stuff on his plate . he pretty much left everything after a few bites . even the chinese fortune cookies tasted old . n ni honestly don t know what happened between us and those who yelped about it previously . i hate leaving bad reviews for any establishment but i really feel everyone needs to be warned before going here .

0,first impression from the outside is big and nice . once you enter it s like being transported back in time except you land in someone s toilet not a casino . i have played probably over million hands of blackjack and i can tell you that this is by far the worst experience ever . i feel they aren t dealing the game fairly and would recommend that you do not play here . the floor people are unaccommodating and rude and the dealers are right out of some asian nightmare . i mean seriously you are working for tips act accordingly you feeling less robot . play here at your own risk . . guaranteed loser . . . might as well hand your bankroll to a hooker and at least have some fun . 
0,"this was awful . n n i rented a car from dollar rent a car with a fixed rate of . per day . when i knew my flight was going to be delayed i called dollar to let them know and they said that nothing would change with my reservation and that my rate would stay the same . i gave dollar my flight number not only when i booked the bar but when i called to let them know that my flight was delayed so that there wouldnt be an issue of me getting the car . when i walked in to the rental car center , they informed me that i was goign to be charged . for friday because i was late , even though i called and let them know that i was going to be late . also , my husband we recently just got married had his wallet stolen at the airport so we had to put the car rental on my credit card wihich he is an authorized user of . . we share the same credit card , its just the name on the card that was different . because of this i was charged an extra . per day total because i am under the age of and we were also charged an extra . per day total of . because he was going to be the driver , the only driver . i never even got behind the wheel of the car . because of the situation , i believe that dollar over charged us by . . this is unacceptable and not treated very well . when i called dollar to explain the situation as i had explain when we rented the car , the two customer service reps were awful , they didnt care what i was saying and basically juse told me i was sol . when i asked for a supervisior , they would not give me a supervisior either . n ni would never ever ever use dollar rent a car again ! it was the worst experience of my life and i felt like a nd class citizen .

0,"looking at the reviews , i know what the problem is here . yeah , not coming back . been to many jj s and this is the worst i go to . will spend my dollars somewhere else . i showed up when the mgr , a really personality dead individual was counting out the drawer . he told me i had to wait . but the sandwich maker said , what are you having , i will get it going . stars with this guy he made my sandwich and wrapped it up . as he put the tape on it i asked him to cut it in half . he started to unwrap and i said , no worries , just cut through the paper and rewwrap it . no big deal from me . as soon as he cut through the paper , the manager , who had people waiting in line , stops helping his customers , turns , points , and yells , dont ever do that again . i was stunned he would yell like that , and the sandwich maker says , what ? the mgr yells again , and louder , dont ever cut through the paper again , if paper gets in the sandwich , then we have to remake it . now i started to tell him that i i asked for that to be done , but this brain dead individual would have nothing of it . he is one of those domineering managers who is my way or the highway . i told the sm guy that i was sorry , and he says , i have to go through this all the time . i have owned businesses and run businesses and there is a time and a place to talk to your employees . never is it to stop what you are doing and yell at someone in front of the whole store . i will eat next door , or down the street , but not here again . lots of stars on this restaurant , i would lay doughnuts to dollars that they started about the time this guy was hired . find another job buddy , you are not a manager and do not need to be the face of a customer service based company .

0,"being a orange county girl , i used to go the yard house in triangle square costa mesa quit often . . . i thought the yard house in las vegas would be the same , but i was more of a let down . i tried the grilled korean bbq beef and it was horribly fatty , by the time i cut the fat off , there was hardly any meat remaining . if the atmosphere was more like the one in triangle square , i probably wouldn t have focused on the food as much as i did . by the time our bill arrived , we had over for nothing good . i probably wont ever go to the yard house in vegas again . . .

0,"i used the wyndham based on a recommendation . it was within walking distance to a meeting . it was also an easy walk to pnc park . the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful during check in . for the price , the room was nothing special . the bathroom was small . n nbut the reason i m writing the review , something i rarely do , is because if the king size bed . it was so soft . i felt like i was sleeping on my head and my back wasn t supported at all . the bed on should be replaced with a new one . "
0,"i was disappointed with this restaurant . the food is not bad by any stretch , but it is not of the quality i expect from a restaurant in this price range and with such a reputation . n ni ordered the special , which for me consisted of a house salad , ribeye , creamed spinach , and dessert . i also ordered escargot and we had garlic cheese bread . n nthe garlic cheese bread was very good . the escargot was flavorful , but i was hoping for escargot served in the shell like i had in paris . the ribeye was cooked perfectly , but the cut seemed to be of average quality . the creamed spinach was too creamy and somewhat bland . the dessert was good . n nthe only reason i ate here is because i had a gift card to spend . overall , it was definitely worth it because of the discount . however , i have no need to return and there are so many other steak houses in las vegas to try . "
0,"save your money and don t do business with this company . we have had a similar situation as the previous review . jim told us for weeks that he would be coming out to fit some shutters there were not working . i called jim every week and every week the phone conversation would end with him saying that he would call me the next morning to let me know when he would be out to fix the problems , but i would never receive a call back . i was always the one to call him and to check in with him . after filing a complaint with the bbb , jim actually called me to tell me how upset he was that i would file a complaint and said he would be coming to our house the following monday to correct the problem . he never showed up , never called , never responded to numerous text messages that i have sent . for someone that is supposedly former law enforcement , i would expect better , but there is a reason he is former . awful , don t waste your time or money ! ! i will make sure i can do as many reviews to make sure no one else makes the same mistake we did and put this business out of business . on a side note , i received a message back from the bbb that said that the business never responded to the complaint . that shows jim s true lack of concern . our sales person was a guy named kurt who raved about the product and gave us a discount because we paid in cash .

0,"service was not good , my burger was worse then something i could make in my own kitchen , and over all presentation wasn t very good . trying to be nice as possible , so i will give them props on a good mint chocolate chip shake . "
0,"food was innovative i suppose and decent tasting . the unfortunate piece was the service and overall lack of etiquette . n n people went to celebrate a birthday and experienced service that can only be described as tragic empty drinks , forgetting about one of the tapas orders , clearing plates without asking and before being finished , entres coming out minutes apart with the excuse of well you wanted it well done , being handed a plate of the chef s cheese selection without being told what any of them were , removing a purchased bottle of wine with wine still in the bottle , none of the soft drinks or tea listed being available , absent and unresponsive wait staff , literally throwing pens on the table for signing the check . we honestly thought they had just opened and were working out some of the glitches . . . apparently they have been open for more than a year n ni could go on but the bottom line is that one should probably not come to this establishment in search of a romantic or well served evening .

0,deleted my review not worthy
0,"after reading the fabulous reviews we had high expectations . i had the lunch special with a slice , salad and drink . my pizza had been sitting around for a while the crust was over done on the bottom . soggy and doughy on the edges . two other members of our party had the same thing and the same complaint about the pizza . the salads and soup were good but not great . my husband ordered just a pizza with pepperoni , sausage and mushroom but thought it was just average . n nthe restaurant was clean , the service was excellent but we felt the food was over priced for just so so quality . if we lived here i might give them a second chance and order something else . n nthe dessert looked great but we weren t offered any o and when the bill came figured it was high enough . "
0,"very disappointing experience . the service was great , but the food was not the quality we expected . i orderded a ceaser salad that was a joke . my husband orderded a lettuce wedge salad that had a dressing that was extremely spicy hot and he normally likes spicy food . there was no indication on the menu that it would be spicy . also we had steak tartare that was also too spicy . my main dish was chicken that was floating in a butter sauce that was also spicy . the sauce on the broccoli was poor . "
0,"a co worker brought in green chili burros from this place about a month ago and they were delicious ! i ve been craving this place since then . today i went back to pick up two green chili burros to go and was completely disappointed with the quality of meat this time around . just about every third bite was met with a mouthful of fat ! by the time that all the fat was picked out of both burros i was left with potatoes and chili . i don t plan on ever returning to this spot for anymore burros . non a side note , if you plan on paying with anything other than cash there is an additional . u a fee added . . . . .

0,"i have brought my dog for a previous shear and another time for a bath . the experiences for my puppy were fine . my puppy does have some fear issues which i told the groomer about . this time i used a different groomer . he shaved his testicles almost to the point of making them bleed . i couldn t figure out why he kept flapping his hears the inside of his ears had scabs on them . he came home to hide in the closets , bathroom and under tables . i had to take him to the vet who actually told me never to go back to the groomer . he has been so traumatized that he has been put on prozac and xanax . i have contacted a trainer to work with him at per hour n ntoday i went back to wag and wash to speak to the manager and tell them what happened and ask to be given back my money for the grooming and costs for the vet and prescriptions . he made copies of the paperwork and told me he would speak to the other manager in another facility and would call me back . im hoping they will do the right thing and reimburse me . n nneedless to say it will be a cold day in hell that i ever go back there again . this whole experience was heartbreaking . "
0,"walking into this incredibly clean , well kept restaurant , i was expecting a great dining experience . while the service was top notch the staff friendly , the main attraction the hamburger was a study in mediocrity . the meat was flavorless , bland and disappointing . n ni indulged in a santa barbara style burger with bacon , and all of the flavor of the sandwich was derived from the toppings toasted bread . the meat could have been mising entirely , and the sandwich would probably still taste the same . the avocado that topped the burger seemed fresh , but lacking any flavor or character . n n take note this burger includes pickles with the avocado . worst flavor combination ever . n nthe bright side of our experience was the onion rings iced tea , both of which were phenomenal . seriously some of the best onion rings i ve had in phoenix . generous portion , great batter , tasty fried to perfection . the iced tea had a flavor profile that i couldn t identify , but was complex and refreshing . n nif ever forced to return to the habit , i will get two orders of onion rings an iced tea . n nhold the burger .

0,"this was our big date night . total bill with tip . service excellent . my dinner was okay i got the grand prix salmon dinner bread hot and delicious , mushroom orzo okay a little bland if you did not eat the garlic croutons . salmon cooked perfectly , apple dessert a little bland . my husband had the grilled plank steak , his romaine salad , good , steak tough disappointing , topping on steak not so good . so much money for a marginal meal . we had been there five years ago and loved the steaks served on a much larger plank . again best waiter ever so we did not send the steak back plus it takes so long to get a different dinner .

0,very sad experience . nye in the worst restaurant in vegas . the worst food i ever had . they had a terrible fix menu . i had to eat room service after i left the restaurant . no recommended at all . 
0,i generally use yelp to discover new places that have good reviews . i m actually writing one of my first reviews because of how disappointed i am . i love port of subs but i really hate this location . i came in today to get a sandwich which seriously had barely any meat on it . compared to the price i was not pleased at all . i bought a large to share with my friend and the sandwich was all lettuce . i m not normally one to complain because i am a hairdresser and i understand the struggle of having customers that you cannot please no matter what you do . but this was seriously displeasing . i will keep my business at the village square port of subs in summerlin . where they don t jip you on meat just because they re too busy talking to their coworker . 
0,"went in with friends for lunch . was greeted warmly and seated . server , although friendly , did not know the menu at all . when i inquired about the brushcetta my correct pronunciation was quickly corrected and she proceeded to describe it as it s just bread . . . . servers need to be better educated on menu and descriptions . menu was an odd mixture with no continuity . the grilled peach and feta salad was really a steak salad with canned peaches . the salad was terrible . the cherry tomatoes were old and wrinkled , the dressing so so , and the mixed greens weren t dressed completely , like the cook ran out of dressing for all the salads ordered . the raspberry bagel that was ordered was really a cinnamon raisin . ordered lemon in our water , but was told there were no lemons . n nunderstandably , this was a soft opening but first impressions do count . i would not return here based on the food , and unknowledgeable servers . chalkboard menu needs better descriptions . and please , if you offer grilled anything , make sure it s fresh , and make sure it s grilled . eliminate the canned food . "
0,"just grabbed lunch there today . had the all white meat teriyaki bowl . it is dry and flavorless . is it really chicken ? turkey or pigeon i think , well at least it s some bird flesh from what i can tell by looks . sauce is flat and lacks flavor . no thrills about a bowl with a little rice and a large portion of meat . no garnish nothing . brought it home and fed it to my dog . she enjoyed it . i want be returning and i m disappointed that all of you think it s so great , the place doesn t even have atmosphere to like .

0,"when we lived in tempe from my family and i used to frequently visit this red devil location because we always were impressed with the quality of food , price and service . after we returned to living in the area after years of living in another state , we made it a point to return to our old hangout spot . i don t know what happened in the five years between visits , but the quality has fallen off badly and that is the nicest possible way i can word it . n nthe poor quality began the moment we walked in the door . the host , who seemed about as enthusiastic to be there as i am when i go get a colonoscopy , greets us with how many ? no hello thanks for coming , or welcome to red devil , how are you today ? or even a slight acknowledgement of appreciation for us being there . then , we have a month old . . percent of restaurants we visit at least ask us if we want a booster seat or high seat . not red devil . we had to ask for one , they fijlnally bring us one after minutes but the damn thing is one without a buckle to keep him safe . then , we ordered an appetizer and our meal . after minutes of waiting , without any interaction with our waitress , which led to four empty drink cups and thirst began kicking in , the woman comes out and notifies us they are really busy in the back . i d give this excuse a fair amount of consideration if there was a line of people out the door . however , along with us , there were no more than three other families there all of whom were dining already when we arrived . then , we finally get our pizza , but no plates . she tosses the pizza down in front of us and walks away . when she finally returns , i have to ask her for plates to use , to which she responds oh you don t already have them ? ? i suppose i asked for plates for my health and they were already on pur table and must have been invisible ones that she could see , but noone else could . topping it all off , our pizza was lukewarm like it had been out of the oven for a half an hour or more , had a finger full of barbeque sauce on the entire pizza we ordered the bbq chicken one and was severely lacking toppings . don t get me wrong , i don t expect the pizza to be loaded and the company to dump every ingredient they have on it , but if i am spending dollars on a pizza i sure as hell don t want to eat just the dough and crust . . and if nothing else , at least make damn sure the thing is barely warmer than room temperature . n ni am beyond disappointed with this experience . . i am not one who complains about every little detail , and generally am an easy person to please . as such , i don t like to hand out negative reviews and really will do so only if the experience is a completely undesirable one . this experience ranks as just that . if i wanted to be treated poorly upon arrival , have a lengthy and unnecessary wait , have to ask for basic dining items , refills and a seat for my son to sit in i d have just gone through the drive through at carl s jr . at least there , i know my food will be hot . n nin conclusion i couldn t wait to get back to red devil after five years . now , it will be a long time before we go back again , if we go at all .

0,view is awesome . music ok . dancing next to g ma and gramps ? not so sexy . came before and it was decent then . came back a second time with the wifee and had to defend why i recommended the place . on top of that had to pay a cover for her and for me . thx voodoo lounge for messing up my street cred . 
0,"am i the only person who wasn t super impressed with this bellagio offering ? n nyeah , the flowers are nice . . . there are teeny , tiny signs with their scientific names for the wannabe horticulturists . n nthere are some pretty birds , and last august , there was a ferris wheel and a liberty bell replica that were , you know , nice . n nbut really , an indoor garden is a must see vegas location ? i think not .

0,"fun place to dance but the business end of it is horrible . i went on my st birthday and was told i need my new id before i come in next time . that s all . i come in with the new temp id that the mvd gave me and say i can t come in without two more forms of id . wish i would ve known that the first time rather than driving all the way back home to get that . the bouncer was also super smart and trying to be funny but in all reality he was just holding up the line and pissing people off . oh , and the drinks are weak . . . cheap but way weak . i ordered a vodka with splash of cranberry and i got a cranberry with a splash of vodka . go after you have pre gamed a bit and don t go if you don t have a horizontal plastic id even though the temp one says this is an official document .

0,"so . . . i thought that they were suppose to be selling chicken strips . . . not chicken nuggets . it was great when it first opened up in las vegas , but it seems that the quality has severely gone down . should have seen my face when i first came back to vegas expecting the great chicken strips that i had left behind . i wouldn t recommend it as i would have before . "
0,"this place needs to be closed down ! why all the hype ? mostly because it looks and feels trendy . at best , it s mold ridden , and a good excuse not to clean the place , and then you add to this the fact that it is dusty . all this aside , the staff is either completely rude , or simply cannot be bothered . after arriving , it took minutes to notice me , even though i was standing at the counter . their online menu is not updated , so when i asked for a smoked salmon sandwich , the response no joke was , we don t carry salmon and fish items , because of the nuclear disaster meltdown in japan . so wait , salmon only comes from japan ? i thought canada had salmon too , no ? the other patrons seemed puzzled by the response , but since they d been waiting for a while , took their seats , when offered hope they had a better time . another minutes elapsed before the gentleman decided to take my order . of course , after this minute investment , it was another minutes for my takeout order to be ready . such a serious waste of time ! their staff also have no concept of balance , when it comes to food , either too bland or just too much bland , or just too sweet compare the sweetened iced tea to the apple juice . super dry bread ! seriously , run if you can , or if your friends insist on going here , tell them that you ll meet them after having a decent meal elsewhere , but be under no illusions if you want terrible service , at a hefty price , with absolutely horrible food ! "
0,"you get what you pay for ! i m gonna try to not be completely negative about this place , but i seriously don t recommend anyone to stay here . it has gross , sticky , smelly old carpet in the hotel rooms , two tiny towels , no conditioner , no mini fridge , no nothing . it flat out sucks here . casino is ok , everything is just out dated . n nbut ! if you re looking for a cheap crappy place to just rest your head after a long night on the strip , this will do just don t expect much , or anything from this place . the good news is , bucca di beppo is located in this hotel , which is delicious .

0,"the hookah there is really not that good , the regular flavors taste awful , the hookahs don t let a good enough draw and they use quick light charcoals , even on the premium hookah . they do not carry al fakher tobacco , the premium they sell is star buzz which taste like candy . nice curtains and deco though , and kudos for the turkish coffee , which ups it to stars . "
0,"is it possible to give a star rating ? if it were , i would give it to this location ! nthis is the worst , worst , worst panera bread i have ever been to . n nwhy do i continue to go there you may ask . . . because it is so close to my house , i have limited options as a vegetarian on the go , and apparently i am a glutton for punishment . n ni have spoken with three different managers regarding the issues i ve had with my meals , and nothing ever seems to change . n ni can finally say that i will not be going back , au revoir !

0,"i am from the oc and when visiting vegas my friend was raving about this place and i gotta say this is the worst crawfish joint i ve ever been too . our food took forever to come out and it was not very good . my friend and i ordered dozen oysters , lb crawfish , lb clams , lb shrimp , fish n chips , and lb snow crabs . nothing was fresh or good except the clams and fish . the crab was a lb and tasted so bland and not fresh . the dozen of oysters was also horrible . worst oysters i ve ever ate and also not fresh . my most expensive dishes were both horrible . our bill for just was including tip . but not only did our food taste like crap , our waitress was very rude that she pushed us off to another waitress . the next day my whole party of all had stomaches and the bathroom was our best friend . it completely ruined my vegas trip , yet alone the car ride home and it lasted for days . never again hot n juicy . . .

0,"i tried the siopao , a pork one and a chicken one . the chicken one was more interesting , but i liked the taste of the pork one better . the sauce for them was unremarkable . that about sums it up unremarkable overall . "
0,have given it a few chances not impressed . family suggested dinner . willing to try it again . around about on a friday evening . lots of empty tables but were told it would be a minute wait because they were waiting for servers to arrive . seems that we could have been seated and ordered drinks while waiting . probably will not be back . 
0,"service is very inconsistent , i just tried to place a carry out order and i was put on hold forever and they kept interrupting my order by putting me on hold so i finally hung up and called olive garden and no such problem ! clearly this place has a terrible manager . the only thing good i can say is eddie is an amazing server if you are so fortunate to have him , others have been terrible . they also refuse to take their own coupons if they are just a few days after expiration , other places like still will accept after expiration if you ask . prices are very high compared to olive garden .

0,"beyond disappointed and embarrassed to have taken my boyfriend s parents here last night . i m a huge fan of guy fieri and was bummed to miss his yelp elite event last month , and was so excited to try this place . epically backfired . n nget this ntriple t fries are delish , but don t eat the creamy white truffle dip no flavor , seems to be sour cream . oh , and they re , so consider yourself warned . nthe hefeweizen beer featured on the current menu is also damn delicious . too bad it took minutes and half of our meal to get to us . n ndon t get nmorgan s greek salad is plated poorly and difficult to cut up and eat the full romaine leaves . only one piece of feta in the entire dish , fell off the plate due to the plating issue and was unable to eat it . the dressing was citrusy and not at all appealing . only greek components of this salad were the feta i couldn t eat and a handful of olives . there was no hummus in this dish as listed on menu , and the croutons were soggy . nthe mayor of flavortown is a dry burger with pastrami of questionable quality . somehow it looked like brisket with a dark color and odd taste . the dijon mustard was also flavorless . served with crinkle cut sweet potato fries that looked and tasted like they were from the grocery store bulk bag . did not finish . n nmaybe take a gamble ndouble barrel bbq wings are cut lollipop style , which was visually pleasing and easier for my bf s dad to consume , and guy s signature bourbon brown sugar bbq sauce was neither bold nor flavorful , making it even more palatable for a guy who hates spice but couldn t find anything else on the menu he wanted to take a gamble on . good dish for the person who ordered it , but not something i can recommend . n nservice was also awful . as mentioned above , we waited minutes for our beers . that is simply unacceptable . we also ordered a margarita that tasted like lemonade and did not seem to have any liquor in it sent it back . should have sent everything back , but at am our options were limited , i didn t want to make a scene in front of my potential future in laws , and quite frankly , we never saw our server . n nreceipt came in an iphone holder , with the device , to complete a dining experience survey about our visit . i would have loved to . but the iphone was out of battery and shut off . seriously ? ! n ni am so embarrassed to have suggested this place and will not be recommending it . spending to like an order of fries is ridiculous . nbad service bad food bad experience .

0,"this shop is so close to my home so i thought i would give this place a try . i will not return . i went today and when i sat down for a manicure , i noticed the floor was filthy and the one technician working there did not even use a clean towel . i was the only person in the shop . i do not know how they stay in business . will be looking for another nail shop to try .

0,"excited to experience a showdown between elote chef jeff smedstad who we have long loved and think is the best mexican chef in the us and the chef at cowboy ciao , we arrived with high expectations for a special meal . the premise was each chef was to prepare dishes , with wine pairings , and the crowd was to vote and pick the best dish and pairings . what a great premise right ? unfortunately , the meal was disappointing . the first shrimp course was cold , overcooked , chewy and flavorless . the other courses that followed were cold , under seasoned and just plain bad in our view . smedstad should be ashamed and embarrassed . his culinary work is so strong at elote . he is a true genius . not sure what happened here , but this food was not up to the standards of a chef of his caliber . the wine pairings were fun however , several of the wines were whites and rose , which is not necessarily a bad thing , but these wines were served about degrees too warm , which made even some very nice wines unpleasant . the restaurant seemed ill equipped to handle a crowd of this size it took way too long to serve each course , which likely explains why the food was cold and the wine was warm . in any event , we will not be back to cowboy ciao .

0,"i have a lot of the same things to say . celebrity is old but has a nice circular stage and great acoustics . dodge is nice and more expensive but a great place to see a concert . my beef with marquee has always been that it is a cheap warehouse and it is a bit of a dump . seeing a concert at a dump can have value too if it has some history or just a cool ambiance environment . marquee has none of the above . i will say that the ketel one tonics were stiff and the bartender was responsive . otherwise , it s pretty hot because the doors are open and they have a couple of large fans inside and that s about it . many bands sound somewhat marginal there because the acoustics are just not very good . however , the concert we saw this week sounded very good so that was a nice suprise . i usually go to rock n roll shows if that gives you and idea of the type of music and the volume . loud . gotta love it .

0,"i am downgrading my last rating of stars . some time ago , i stopped going to shogun because of an unfortunate fish incident . time passed , and my husband and i recently decided to give their happy hour a try . we parked the car , walked toward the door , and were hit with a bad oil smell that completely changed our minds .

0,"got a tattoo here a few months ago by mario . i m satisfied with the results of my tattoo , but the overall experience was a little meh . mostly because i came in with a friend and they treated her quite differently than they treated me . i have red and black hair , and multiple tattoos . i had an idea in my head , and didn t bring a photo with me . my friend is brunette and only has one other tattoo . she brought in a photo of exactly what she wanted . mario gave her a really hard time about doing it exactly how it is in the photo . i understand as an artist you want to be more original , but if somebody is going to pay you , especially for a simple minute tattoo , then i think you should just do it . my tattoo was drawn up quick and done even quicker , because it was just a simple word in old school font . hers took probably times the time it should have , and she was so upset with how it was turning out that she wouldn t let him finish and left in tears . not only was it unfinished , and not at all how she wanted it , but she had to pay to have another artist fix it , and it took forever to heal because he basically jabbed the needle so hard into her ankle that it ended up getting infected . you may prefer to do more original work , but you aren t the one with this on your body forever . if you don t like a tattoo , and don t want to do it how the person wants it . . . then say no , and send them to another artist . it s as simple as that .

0,"this restoration hardware embodies pretty much everything that i dislike about the stereotypical scottsdale business . it oozes pretension what furniture store needs their own valet parking , especially when the parking garage is literally right across the street from it ? , with salespeople that won t give you the time of day if they don t consider you worthy of shopping there . i passed by at least salespeople who walked by , ignoring me . n ni walked in and looked at all the furniture . every single piece had the same drab , linen pale beige , burlap sack colored fabric on it . from the looks of it and since no salesperson deigned to talk to me to let me know otherwise , it seemed like the furniture upholstery only came in this color , and in this linen like , sack like fabric . i know now after looking at the website that there are actually a multitude of fabrics and colors to choose from . why would they put the same exact , pedestrian shade and fabric on all their furniture , on all floors ? variety is good ! it lets customers know that your furniture is customizable ! n nthe only person there that actually talked to me was their valet , who thanked me and wished me a good day even though i didn t use their services . their salespeople could take some lessons in customer service from him !

0,"hated it ! remember the in living color sketch , men on film ? no ? basically just say hated it in a sassy gay voice and that is exactly how i feel about the hotel san carlos . maybe snap your fingers and pierce your lips after saying it too . n ni thought it would be fun . i thought it would be cool . i drove by a million times and said to myself , i wanna get a room there one of these days . unfortunately , when that day arrived i was severely disappointed . n ni knew it was old and i thought that would be part of the charm , but it wasn t . that s the problem . it s just old and crappy , not historic and charming . there is a difference . maybe it would have been more charming if the staff knew what they were doing . not a single basic question i asked could be answered by the girl working at the front desk . the vallet guy was never around . never . so that made it a little hard to , you know , vallet my car . the king bed we upgraded to was just two small beds pushed together . man , i love sleeping in the crack ! so comfortable . want a late checkout , no problem . . . oh , wait , problem . the night person and the morning person seem to be on different pages . n nbottom line , someone needs to send their employees to a class on customer service and maybe even give them a print out of their job descriptions . oh , hey , you know what . . . that someone is you , hotel san carlos management . n n disclaimer i might be pmsing as i write this review . n n yes , that is a legit excuse . n n for me , not the hotel staff .

0,"just because a business is in a nice area . doesn t mean it s the automatic bees knees ! i hate giving low star reviews , i really do . but boy oh boy , the trouble we went through to get to this place just wasn t worth it . n ni ve never been to the scottsdale quarter , parking was horrible . do i really need to valet park to go shopping ? really ? anyways after driving around the thing times we finally decided to park in a loading zone . it said minutes , well minutes was all we needed . i was going to get a smoothie so i figured the energy boost from my smoothie will give me the endurance and stamina i need to chase the car down the street if i don t make it back in time and it gets towed so i wasn t worried . n nthe place was nice and small . it had a nice look to it that made it seem like we was really in for a treat . i know it s not october but we got tricked instead of the treat . i will admit i am being kind of harsh on the place . the girl who helped us was very nice and informative of the drinks . but like other yelpers have said , they were out of a few things . my girlfriend got the weekend warrior i believed . which consisted of almond milk , vanilla , honey , and few other things . hers had a nice taste and even better aftertaste . i should ve got one of those . instead i got the immunie . and the only thing the immunie was immune to was providing good taste . it seriously tasted like very bad watered down orange juice . i would ve been more happy if they gave me a packet of tang and said have it . the drink was such a rip off at over . seriously , every time i took a drink i would just look at the drink with a stank eye and just wanted to punch the cup . cause i felt like a idiot for continuing to drink this mugging in a cup . every time i took a sip i said eight dollars ! i ve never wanted to punch a cup before in my life until that day . n neven after saying all that , i would try the place again . if i happen to be in the area . i went out of my way to find the place . i won t make that mistake again , cause it was not worth it . i usually like to give a place a couple chances and try something else on the menu before i review it . but that drink just mad me angry at how bad it was for the price that they charged . i think when i got done with that watered down orange juice and was about to throw the cup away it spoke to me . it said knock knock . . . who s there ? orange . . . orange who ? orange you glad i took your money ? no . . . i m not . that last part my have been a dramatization .

0,i went there yesterday based on the rating on yelp and quite frankly i don t think they deserve that many stars . many traditional dim sum dishes available and serve from carts but their food is not fresh and way too oily . the restaurant look outdated . i ve been to many dim sum restaurants but this one is just not good . customer service is pretty good .

0,"expected an amazing experience . . . was a bit let down . sushi was ok but not creative at all . was trying not to compare , but the sushi at virago in nashville is leaps and bounds better try the ecuador roll ! . server was pushy and annoying . was glad to get out of there and get to the living room at our hotel the w scottsdale where sushi roku resides . n ntip if you stay at the w you get a card for a free appetizer tasting at sushi roku . this ended up being just an amuse from the chef that they took off the bill because of the card we received and after lots of questions about what we liked and didn t like meatballs came out as the amuse . that is not an appetizer tasting experience it was an amuse which in nashville means super cool thing a chef makes that is free and makes you happy . not the same at sushi roku . left me disappointed .

0,"okay this place belongs to the guy that put foodtv on the map ! so either we are going in here with way too high expectations or it is overrated . n ni think it s a little of both . n ni was very disappointed here . i had seared tuna it may have been the fish of the day ? it was very bland , it was so disappointing . nothing that we had was very memorable . n nthe service was very good and the place looks great , but it just wasn t what i had expected . like a lot of these places in las vegas they re in a casino , this one is in the mgm grand . i wonder how involved emeril lagasse really is in this place . i certainly have no information to say that he isn t , but if the food is any indication i would say he s either overrated or he doesn t stop in very often .

0,"i can t comment on the food because we were unable to stomach the atmosphere long enough to eat there . the restaurant was empty and from the dark bar we were shouted at to sit where we d like . the table we chose was filthy and when i pointed out that there was food all over it the waitress said that we had simply chosen the dirty table . her temperament was clearly off and she was not happy to have patrons , although there was no one else in the entire place . we asked for water and waited for menus . the water glasses game smudged with prints and coated in food and we left without much hesitation . very very disappointed in the service of such a well reviewed sushi spot .

0,i have ordered oliveos pizza quite a bit in the past . the owner is a very cool person but the delivery staff is unbelievable . i ordered a pizza at pm and i called to ask eta at am and he said the driver had just left . he arrived at am . when i asked the delivery driver . . . very politely . . . if the food was cold . he copped a very rude attitude . the total was . and i asked for back . he once again was rude and didn t notice the dollar i pulled out of my wallet to hand him which is a very generous dollar tip i usually don t like to report bad service and this is my first posting on yelp but in my opinion the service is just as . . . if not more important than the food . i will be picking up from now on . . .

0,"i ve been wanting to try this place for a while . i mean , even if it s fast food . . . it s a place that specializes in chicken fingers . that s pretty much all they do . so they have to have the most amazing , flavourful chicken fingers ever , right ? n nnope . i mean , they weren t the most awful chicken fingers i ve ever eaten there was some moisture there but they were bland . so disappointingly bland . the dipping sauce thousand island dressing ? helped a little , but i won t be hopping back in my car to buy more . popeyes is further away , but much tastier .

0,"waited for minutes , then was told the computer dropped our order and should be out soon . we left hungry because we had to get to an appointment . my husband called and spoke to the manager , donna , who said they had been having that problem all morning . she said she saw us sitting for a long time with no food , but the server told her it was coming out soon . if you know you are having a computer issue and you saw a table with no food for that long in a nearly empty restaurant , would you not check with the kitchen to make sure the ticket was in and ask why it s taking so long ?

0,"ho boy , i was excited for a ramen specialty shop to finally open in chubana . this restaurant did a superb job in crushing all my ramen dreams . n nfirst off , the neophyte employees don t seem to understand how ramen refills work . first off , you can only order extra noodles during your order . instead of putting the noodles in an empty bowl , they just add it into your ramen when it s made . n nif working on a monday had a flavor , it would taste like the noodles and broth served here . the noodles tasted fairly mundane and the broth itself was bland . what surprised me was that the curry chicken ramen i ordered was done chinese style rather than japanese style . what this means is that the chicken in the ramen had bones , so it was fairly annoying randomly biting into bones while i ate my food . also , the flavor of the broth didn t really resemble japanese curry it seems that they tossed some hot spices in the hopes that we wouldn t recognize that it s not japanese curry . n nalso , i was surprised by the rave trance music playing in the background . . . i m no fan of this sort of music , but i honestly wonder if the owners did some sort of market analysis and found out what uiuc students like listening to . it wasn t even good rave music either . they had a rave version of justin bieber s baby . i don t really have anything against him , but i do question the music selection here . n nnot only was stomach absolutely pissed at what i had subjected it to , my wallet was equally furious as well . the ramen bowls cost around each they normally cost at other places . but when you re the only ramen specialty shop in town , i suppose you can charge whatever you want . "
0,"i stopped in the other day for the first time in a long time . the music was so loud they couldn t hear people s orders , and it sounded like cats being killed in a bordello . n the first person in the food making line started my burrito . then it sat there getting cold until the second person could get to it . they built it and passed it to the wrapper . i understand being new at a job , but it was leaking from every side ! n they asked if it was ok to use to tortillas to wrap it , it wasn t but it wasn t going to be able to even lift it so i said yes . n taste was ok except all the gristle , i don t remember that as a problem with the chicken before . ni ate outside where it was quiet except for the beggars and hookers . "
0,"so the family and i were out and about thinking to hit another spot to grab a bite to eat before we possibly catch a movie . well since the wait at the other place was considerable we decided to walk the mall and see what could be offered . noff we went and came across a place that looked nice and offered a favorite of ours sushi ! ! ! ! nas we walked in on the friday night the air hummed with a vibrant busy spot where people were getting drinks , listening to the banter and pnash of hibachi cooks doing their most awesome , and an appealing sushi bar that was begging us to try their delectable fishy treats . nthe hosts at the front exceeded our expectations . they were obviously busy and very much hustling but promised a possible thirty minute wait and seat us at the next available table at the sushi bar . true to their words that s exactly what they did ! refreshing considering how often you are told it ll be thirty minutes only to wait forty five to an hour . nthen the disappointment and hilarity begins . nafter being seated we grabbed menus and began formulating our plan for sushi bliss . while we were planning our awesomeness a server passed us multiple time . no welcome , no glass of water , be right with you , nothing . so here i sit with my family tummy grumbling waiting for that moment to get some great sushi to grub on . so we waited , waited some more , waited some more still . . . did i mention we waited . . . then after forty five minutes of additional waiting at our table , without even a glass of water , we received a text message from the other place and left to spend our money elsewhere . nas a courtesy to the manager eugene i called back to the yokoso to inform him of our experience . not to be rude or complain but to just let him know so he could possibly address it and save another family the discomfort . at first he seemed appreciative and wanted us to come back in to enjoy the restaurant . he asked me to call back the following morning to arrange a time and come experience yokoso at it s best . so in turn i obliged and called back in the morning and the afternoon with no success getting a hold of eugene . i left my name and number and yet each time i called he was on break and would call me back . well i m still waiting for that call back and have avoided posting about this experience because i wanted to be fair and afford them the opportunity to follow through with what that they said they would do . ni can t speak to the quality of the food in fact it looked down right delectable but the lack of service to the point no service ruined the desire to try them out . not to mention the fact that when management fails to live up to their word and blows you off it tells me they don t value the customers because hey there will be another one walking down the sidewalk any minute . there in lies the problem though ! n nso this is me telling you the potential diner stay away save yourself the potential for a frustrating experience . just skip it and go somewhere else where they value their customers and want you to come back !

0,"the first time i tried this restaurant was almost years ago . i am of a thai and chinese origin so i have been eating thai dishes all my life . i know that the restaurant doesn t really target thai person but still they should make at least decent food . my friends and i ordered green curry , stirred fried spicy flat noodle . the green curry was a bit watery green curry supposed to be a bit thick and creamy with coconut milk , the spicy flat noodle was so so and the way they cooked the flat noodles was not quite the way it supposed to cook . . the service was ok not excellent . n ni was there once and decided not to go back there again . to me the only good thing about this restaurant is its ambience .

0,"the concept was nice but this place really didn t live up to expectations . there are some standard type store in it , but it doesn t seem to be a functional type mall as much as a tourist destination . the rainforest cafe was the highlight for me , which isn t really saying much . i didn t really find a whole lot of places i actually wanted to go into here .

0,this place is a train wreck . we waited at least minutes maybe for a server to come to our table . finally i got out of our booth and flagged him down . his name is lance and he is without a doubt one of the most obnoxious jerks i have ever come across . when i complained about the wait he essentially said that they were short handed and if i didn t like it we should leave . naturally i walk to the front and asked for the manager . i was told by the hostess that she wasn t there big surprise . she did give me her card . i called and left a message but no return call . i will never go to any ihop ever again . absolutely pathetic .

0,"after waiting minutes to have our order taken , an additional minutes to get our water , another minutes after that to get our food , and then minutes after we finished eating to get our check , i was way less than pleased with the service . my boyfriend got the torta del rey the rubber hot dogs in it ruined it for me . it also smelled weird . too much going on maybe ? ick ! glad i didn t order it ! i got the carne asade burrito instead . which actually means bean burrito with a few tiny pieces carne asade mixed in . that was really annoying . the beans did taste good though . over all extremely unimpressed with this place . maybe we went on a bad day , but neither of us think we ll be back to find out . bummer !

0,"i went to this place to use a groupon and because i miss the food from hawaii well . . some of it anyway . the food here was pretty typical of a fast food place , not very fresh and the meat was very poor quality and fatty . i got the curry chicken and the bf got the bbq beef . they were pretty meh . i also have tried the veggie noodle soup which was probably the best thing i have had here . it was not good but it was better for sure . i probably wouldn t go back .

0,"this hotel is awesome to look at from the outside but not so great on the inside . my family and i went to their nye party in the showroom and experienced a mediocre show with a semi out of tune band , two bars with tenders who couldn t figure out how to make consistent and decent cocktails , and security who promptly threw us out after my sister slipped on a balloon from their ball drop . they were very rude . after spending almost on tickets , we thought we would receive better service . if you re looking for a good place to party , this is not the place . they seem more interested in catering to the folks playing their slot machines .

0,good food bad service ! recommend just doing take out ! 
0,"lacking . this was not the worst cup i ve ever had , but the place left a lot to be desired . i opted for their ethiopian off a v , and when i prodded the girl at the counter for a little more info about it , i . e . where was it grown , she looked at me crooked and said ethiopia . inspiring . another woman behind the counter who sort of looked like she could have been the owner said that was a valid question , but didn t know the answer and didn t bother to find out . the technique on the pour itself was poor . splashing water over grounds does not make good coffee . . . especially when half the water is poured straight down the filter . these folks need proper training . the cup itself was marginal . under extracted likely due to bad technique , and the characteristics of the cup were such that , to me , suggested the roast had gone too long in the drum , slightly carmalized and somewhat scorched . lacking the bright acidity that draws me to beans from this origin . considering the near non existent coffee culture i guess there s not a ton of motivation for a shop to shine when they can squeak by on a convenient location , but really , if you re going to do something , do it well .

0,"have not stayed here yet , but it was not too soon for my first impression . after reserving my room a few days ago , i called back because i never received my confirmation email . turns out they had my email wrong a letter was missing . no big deal right ? wrong ! the woman who took my call was short with me and basically kept telling me that my email was spelled correctly not sure how she would know . anyhow , i insisted on the correct spelling and then finally received my confirmation . i thanked her for her time , even though i was not very impressed and she hung up without another word . really sheraton ? i hope you know that i am staying at your hotel because there is no marriott nearby for my conference . i ve never been treated like that by marriott or even the best western for that matter . nicely done . hopefully i can update this review in october when i stay with a nice glowing revival of your staff and your hotel ! "
0,"wow . . . talk about a backwards shop . the computer system is from the early s and i had to use a phone to make a western union transfer . if there ever was a location that required updating , this would be the one . it doesn t even need to be updated to modern day , the late s would be fine as well .

0,"ok , so my girlfriend and i have tried to come here our last visits to burgh , and it was never open on mondays sucky . so needless to say my anticipation was rather built up before entering . . . n ni am not an art culture history buff at all , but i do know some of his work . . . pretty much all the famous stuff campbell s soup can stuff , monroe photos , etc . what i did not know is that his intention in life was only to be as famous as possible with as little effort as possible . n nexample most of his famous works were done using silk screening . . . i learned that he did the designs in a sketch which could have been done by my week old nephew , had someone else make the silk screen patterns for him , than he did the first few pieces . . . and let someone else make the rest after he liked them . that s b . s . n nexample he had his own magazine called the interview , and i learned the only reason he started it was just to meet and hang out with stars and famous people . he really didn t care what they had to say , he just wanted to be seen with them . . . a good plan , but that doesn t make you an artist . . . n nexample the tv show he did was god awful and he just wanted to be in front of the camera like the famous people he interviewed . . . again to try and be more famous n nexample his work really isn t that inspired . . . and he totally sold out to main stream media , pretty much saying , hey ! look ! i hang out with elvis and marilyn monroe and i am doing this great work , call it art , shove it down your stupid throats and make you pay millions for it ! n ni was very unimpressed , and pissed i had to pay a pop plus parking to see this guy make movies talking like an uneducated idiot , see tranny men deep throat bananas , walk into a room of balloons and call it interactive and finally , see a silk screen piece the size of the side of a barn , of a camouflage pattern ! ! ! and have someone say that s art . . . n nnot worth the visit . . . only reason it s stars instead of is b c it was degrees that day in pittsburgh and the place had free water and a . c .

0,"you know the saying , you get what you paid for well this hotel is the definite meaning of that . i ll admit the price was cheap but the quality of the hotel definitely matched the price . when we arrived and checked in , we had a reservation for a king size bed and they told us that they don t have anymore king size beds available and would we consider a double queen size bed room which ended up being a queen full size bed smallest queen size i ever slept on i mean c mon ! what was the point of calling it a reservation when it wasn t even reserved for us in the beginning . well we eventually got our king size bed the next day , but still it was bad business . we also noticed the type of people that stayed at these hotels were super ghetto ! it was like compton , east la , with rednecks sprinkled around the place all in one . . . kinda felt like prison nover all i will not be staying here again unless some serious re modeling has been done to make this place appealing to the eye . "
0,"went here for a to go order . it took minutes wait time . beef brisket had way too much fat . cole slaw , baked beans , and sweet potato casserole were very sweet for my taste . pulled pork was a little sweet but good . the green beans were good . i ordered dinners which totaled . this is way out of line compared to other bbq places in town . "
0,"if there is such thing as no star that will be how i would have rated this place . went in for a haircut and came out with chopped . even showed picture and all , when the stylist started cutting i knew i was in trouble . i came back after days to get it fix but was told the same person who cut my hair originally would have to do it . will not go back nor recommend this place . "
0,"absolutely the worst . completely ruined my silk shirt and wouldn t do anything about it except offer to dry clean it again which wouldn t do anything . it was returned to me ripped in the back and stained on the front . a reputable dry cleaner would pay to replace it but no he only insulted me by saying i bought it in like that and said it was too tight on me and i spilled food on it . no , it s a silk shirt . who wears a silk shirt tight ? nobody . this is bullshit . don t give them your business . wouldn t even refund the to clean it .

0,"i went to see o sullivan for a nd opinion about other options before deciding on a hysterectomy . next day , i get a nasty call from her instructing me to rush myself to good samaritan b cuz according to her lab result , i was chronically anemic , making it sound like i was dying therefore i needed to undergo a blood transfusion asap . i was in shock asked for time to see who can take me . she insisted i drive myself which didn t make sense . she reported she has reserved a bed for me my blood units have been waiting since am . i arrived the hospital pm was sent to my room to wait for these blood units to arrive . in other words , an order wasn t even placed until i arrived . even worst , it didn t arrive until pm . the whole while i was waiting in the expensive private room , the hospital team kept insisting o sullivan reported i was there for a hysterectomy . i was even threatened that if i don t cooperate with the hysterectomy , i would die . i told them i thought i was there for a blood transfusion . after being interrogated for hours , i became to understand getting a hysterectomy would be a financial convince for o sullivan . i saw my pcp after the transfusion was told i didn t need the transfusion . all i needed was daily iron pills . when o sullivan s office called me to schedule the hysterectomy , i informed them i no longer want services from o sullivan will be seeking services elsewhere . they attempted more times to schedule a hysterectomy . njust last week , i received a certified letter from o sullivan stating she will no longer provide services for me because i refuse to follow her medical advice . what part of i no longer want her service did she not understand ? ? ? ? nshe didn t care for me or about me , she just wanted to butcher me for her financial sake . as if she had a ballon payment due i could ve been her ticket . it s been months since she her hospital team threatened i would die . makes me wonder how many others she has victimized .

0,"overprice and overrated ni was here on a friday for lunch . the service was abnormally slow as it took the waiter over half hour to bring us our drinks . nthe nachos were worse than the ones at kelsey s barley any cheddar cheese nthe drinks were weak and the fries were super , super greasy ! ni will never go here again ! "
0,"awful . awful . awful . worst service i have ever had , bad food , cold food , overpriced . n nwhere do i start ? we waited minutes to get in for breakfast . it was the worst service and food i have had in a long time , and extremely overpriced particularly considering the awful food and awful service . my husband and i got mimosas why not ? we are on vacation and they were each . we expected a large wine glass for our . instead , we received the smallest , tiniest champagne glass i have ever see . it was a shot of champagne for . no thanks . i ll pass . n nthen my husband and i got the eggs benedict to eat . he got the traditional and i got their special one . all of the eggs were overcooked , didn t even run out when you broke them open . they were basically hard boiled eggs . the sauce over them was tasteless and cold . everything , in fact , was cold and unseasoned . it was awful . n nthe service through the entire meal was awful but when we tried to pay the bill , we were ignored for at least minutes . we almost walked out and i have never walked out on a check . when i finally got up to complain and get someone to take our credit card , the manager brought the check but did not ask how the food was or if everything was ok . even the management didn t care . this is cafeteria food for per plate . there are farrrrr better places in vegas and even in the paris to eat , for much much more reasonable of a price .

0,"delhi palace was really my first experience with indian food , with its location near asu and whatnot . so , obviously , i liked delhi palace . until i tried other indian places , that is . i have since come to the realization that delhi palace is actually incredibly bland by indian food standards . they sometimes have a decent selection of dishes , but if you re looking for good flavor , drive up the road a couple miles to taj mahal . "
0,"if i could give this place a star i would . when i go through the drive through , i expect my food order to be correct . how hard is it to mess up two ice cream cone orders ? and because it s hot out , how hard is it to take a cone and put it upside down in a bowl so it doesnt melt all over me on my way home ? n napparently the workers can t even fathom this crazy contraption and give me a plastic dish that s not what i wanted . n nunless you want to deal with idiots don t come here . that is all . "
0,"i gave it one star because i had to this is by far the worst service and food i ve had however juliana was awesome if they had two of her i might not have had to wait an hour for my miso soup with four squares of tofu . asian lady kept taking orders never writting a single item down which also meant we didnt get anything we asked her for . . funniest thing was when he told one of my friends that she couldn t order because she had already placed an order , all she had ordered was more ginger lol anywho for the price stay away ! ! ! ! ! "
0,i wanted to try this place since i always drive by it . we walked into the restsurant and i got a huge whiff of the worst smell in your life . we immediately walked out and went to applebee s . the food couldn t possibly be good . i surprised thus place hasn t been condemned by now . 
0,very disappointed was our first time at the restaurant and we have to wait more than minutes to get my food but not my wife s food so we have to walk out the server was very friendly but she don t give us a reason . why our food was taking so long
0,bad service . i would rate zero star if possible . they didn t serve us because we were waiting for friends coming . extremely bad service . don t go there if you are in a group
0,"this review is a result of an experience with the gentlemen enrique at the security stand next to the cashier s cage . my girlfriend lost her debit card at daylight beach club on labor day so i contacted lost and found to see if they have it . sure enough they had it and the lady i spoke with on the phone said i could pick it up at the security stand . n nwhen i approached the security stand and mentioned girlfriend s debit card , enrique immediately cut me off saying , listen here buddy , even if you were her spouse we re not going to give it to you . this is a matter of money , she can come down here herself and get it . i asked what time would she be able to get it , trying to fight back coughs at the same time i had a frog in my throat , and enrique snapped a , what did you say to me ? as if i was back talking him under my breath . n nthe whole time i was interacting with enrique it felt like he was talking down on me . he was not empathetic at all towards my cause . his general attitude was , you re an idiot for thinking you can come down here and pick up someone else s card , despite what the lady on the phone said . as if i was an extreme inconvenience to him for approaching his security stand . n nworking in the hotel business myself , i m extremely disappointed someone like enrique is allowed to work on a las vegas strip property . that attitude does not belong in the hospitality business . "
0,"so sorry to have to do this but i have to give this place a star . megan if that s her real name told me i was not on the guestlist . the problem is she just kept scrolling through the guestlist on her ipad without carefully looking for my name . at that point i got the hint . she did not want to honor the guestlist but wanted me to go into the general admission line to pay . she was dismissive of me . but i realize it may not be just her . so i m gonna go ahead and point the finger at management too . n nafter wasting all that time in the guestlist line , i decided to just get into the general admission line to pay my to get in . maybe the experience in here will turn things around . n ni get in and i am not that impressed . looks typical . n nhere is my ranking n n xs n lights n surrender n marquee n vanity n pure n hyde n xs s restroom n surrender s restroom n hakkasan n nat least hakkasan is in the top ! n ni have to say after going to this club , my appreciation for the others are much greater . i m sure in time you will work these issues out hakkasan , but it wouldn t hurt to have better personnel . good luck to you guys . i wish you could refund my money but hey i know it s vegas and i gambled that hakkasan was going to be the best club ever . guess i lost .

0,"i ve been here twice . once for dinner . i ordered chicken tikka masala and also a fried veggie chickpea side dish . the masala is okay the chicken is a bit hard . n ni went here for the lunch buffet . none of the food was hot , and they were serving meat . it was covered but seemed to not be heated in any way . i ate at noon , and the buffet starts at am , so i wasn t even at the tail end . definitely some health concerns with that . n nif you go , don t go to the lunch buffet . "
0,the food was tasty and the people were nice but they serve everything on styrofoam and use all plastic utensils . it s not that hard for a diner to buy a damn dishwasher . n ni m not the biggest tree hugger out there but eating here made me feel ick . n ni d gladly pay an extra dollar to get a glass reusable plate . 
0,"if i could , i d give them negative stars ! nnever have i had such rude customer service before . this review isn t even for the food because we never made it there . first off , let me get this straight , party of but only of us are eating because the other were younger and ate already . we had to watch them . initially we ordered only entrees cause . price is quite steep and . wasn t sure on quality of the food . after we place the order and told our waitress that we re sharing , she goes order ? ! that s it ? wow ! then storms off to talk to the chef in the kitchen . comes back minutes later to basically trying to explain that they want more orders or we re just hogging space . keep this in mind though , the place was empty and we weren t deterring from their business at all . but due to her rudeness we decided this is not where we want to eat and got up and left . never have i been rudely treated like that before .

0,"great location in middle of strip cool casino restaurants n nour room was not clean ! ! ! ! dusty as hell . there was pills on the floors from previous guest . . . how hard is it to vacuum ? sink was clogged . n nself parking is horrible be aware if u drive n park , you have to walk through the miracle mile mall after you fight for parking . the walk itself prob take up to minutes sucks if you are in a rush . . . way better options in terms of rooms to stay in . "
0,the hotel is nice at first glance . but if you are sensitive to smell watch out you will be sick with massive headaches . they said it was the cleaning solution but i believe it is mildew . nif you are a smoker and can t smell anything it will be fine for you . 
0,this place refused to serve me after beer . this place is a joke and should go out of business already . 
0,"ive been here two times both times the place was not impressive . first time the sushi tasted bad and bland and they didnt fill my water up the whole time . the second time i ordered chicken teriyaki , i thought this would be a cant go wrong dish . wrong , it had fillers in the chicken plate such as onions and carrots . the chicken didnt even taste like teriyaki . the bento boxes are reasonable but the food is subpar . i think you should stay away from this place because of bad food , subpar waitressing and expensive pricing for what you get . i hope they improve because the food is not great nor even appetizing . "
0,"wow i m surprised to see all the good reviews after my terrible experience here today ! the food left something to be desired and our waiter only came around about every minutes causing the awful experience to drag on forever . n nthe menu is funny , which is great . however it doesn t describe the food very well . i ended up ordering a chicken quesadilla only to find it was made with mozzarella cheese and had mushrooms all through it . it smelled and tasted like pizza rather than a quesadilla . thankfully the waiter saw me trying to dig the mushrooms out one of my least favorite foods unfortunately and offered to get me something different . i ended up getting a chopped salad which was mediocre . . . i guess i had already soured on the place at that point . our appetizer , the britney spears , was good though ! n n nthe place is nice . it just seems like they are trying a little too hard and unfortunately missed the mark for me . "
0,"disgusting food , disgusting desserts . n nit s all superficial here everything looks good until you take a bite out of it . the pastas and noodles were overcooked and oversauced , the fried foods you usually can t go wrong with those were good until i bit into one that was all breading and oil , and the mac n cheese didn t fail to disappoint . n nthe desserts were bitter or plain disgusting and the soft serve ice cream was icy and cheap tasting . the cookies , which looked really good did not live up to their looks . n ni do give hometown buffet two stars however , for their dinner rolls and mushrooms . those , well . . . those were pretty awesome . "
0,"i stopped by kirk s before a show at the nile theater . people need to know that this place is attached to a best western hotel and it s dirty and gross . it was very crowded and they only had two bartenders that were extremely slow . it took us minutes to get two beers . it is , however , one of the only bars on main st that is open on sundays .

0, this review is long overdue . . . and strictly based on my room n nstayed at mandalay bay at the end of last year and it was ok . what i really remembered was that there was a hole in my sheets . . . and this is before i slept in the bed ! i wondered how housekeeping could have missed a hole the size of my hand when they were making the bed . . . n nmy favorite part of the room was the bathroom . . . n ni think the hotel is just getting old and needs to be revamped . it is not a bad property but compared to all the newer properties on the strip . . . n nalso went up with some friends to the hotel side of mandalay bay and it was much nicer ! if you choose this hotel i would recommend that you stay there . 
0,"reading the reviews , i get the impression this show varies quite a bit in terms of quality and it seems like some of the filler acts get changed in out . the version we saw was lousy , unfunny and frankly , one section was just grotesque so we got up and left . n n there was actually an exposed male in the act we saw , which was funny the first time they pulled the joke , but not the third , fifth or eighth . n n there are a lot of strobe flash lights that go off pretty randomly . for anyone that has triggers based on light flashes , this is not the show for you . n n i can see a funnier , better drag queen for two dollars on tuesday night where i live , and probably see more entertaining dancing the same night . n n we did not see the costumes from the posters in fact , there are barely any costumes at all during the balletic acrobatic numbers . this show would have been much more exciting had there been any sort of tease . n n in actual burlesque , there are a couple of versions of the act depending on the audience . if the audience isn t going for it , it gets ratcheted down . in this show , they simply play canned laughter and goading to make sure the show carries on . it was clear we didn t want to see the g string , and it would have been better if they had a backup plan for when the audience wasn t into it . n n the good acts the fishbowl , a balletic piece and a tango between a ribbon weilder and a dwarf lasted less than ten minutes of the forty five minutes we saw . n n finally , this is the reason we got up an left there was an act , about halfway the way through where a woman in nothing but a flesh colored g string is doing acrobatic tricks while danging from black ropes to make it appear as though she is fighting with the ropes . the whole time the sound track is her screaming no and yet climaxing . for anyone that has ever been assaulted , or been denied use of their safeword that is incredibly unsettling . i don t know who ok d that act , but it was horrible .

0,"i was at tigerlilly for sunday lunch . n nscallop , melon watercress for starter . the scallops were cooked just right , and tasted wonderful , light , fresh and sweet . n nbelly of pork for main course served on a bed of mash and greens . this looked quite delicious , however as was the case with my ex wife looks can be deceiving . the meat itself was tough and lacked any real flavor . the mash and greens were all too more ish , nice and buttery . all this is sad as the same dish at rick s a sister restaurant to tigerlilly was very good . n n clark s scottish cheeses for dessert was served with oatmeal biscuits , a nano dollop of spiced pear chutney a piece of organic honeycomb that was i swear the size of a mini shreddie . the different pieces of cheese were an insultingly small . square and . of an inch deep . there was dunsyre blue , either a camembert or , brie and a young and plastically tasting cheddar type cheese . the cheeses were served at a decent room temperature . n nthroughout the meal i was persistently being asked if i wanted anything else and if i wanted to order a drink , i was not left alone long enough i thought . n npresentation for all dishes was spot on . sadly , i observed a table where the guy was served before the ladies he was with for out of their courses , poor etiquette especially as it was mother s day imho . n na terrible let down for me , hence the star rating .

0,"there s something scary about going through a drive thru that s dark . come around the bend from ordering at the sign and you may think you are about to be the first victim in a new horror flick . the bushes are overgrown , weeds popping up around them . then you pull around and see you have to go through a dark tunnel . n na dim light flickers overhead , you hear the hum of your car engine and smell the exhaust . you pull up to the rickety window and as it opens you almost expect an axe wielding murderer to be on the other side . you silently pay for your food in fear that you may say the wrong thing to bring on the wrath of the employee . n nas you quietly pull away , you think you re almost free until you hear the ding ding of the bell that reminds you of pulling up to the gas pumps . as you pull back into the light of daylight you think to yourself , i survived ! n nwell almost , that is until you discover now you have to dodge pedestrians on the sidewalk and then pray to god that you can get back onto carson st . good luck with that . n ni wouldn t step foot in this place . yes , it looks all nostalgic from the outside , but once you get inside it just looks rundown . n nas far as burger king goes , take the time to go elsewhere .

0,"ok , first and foremost this is a review of my total experience , not just my consultation . n ni was referred to amomi by my obgyn . prior to being seen , they request your insurance information , contact your insurance carrier to make sure that the services are covered , then they call you back with a yay or nay . n nwell , i was called back with a yay , went in and met with dr . harris , and a few months later . . . get the bill for my minute chit chat with her she seemed nice , but ? for what ? . n nbelieving this must be an error how is it possible that was covered when they assured me that they had contacted my insurance carrier ? , i contacted the billing department , they said they would fix the error , and i went along my merry little way . . . and a couple of months later got another bill . . . and an additional late fee . . . so then i spoke with their billing department again , they told me that they saw the history and information from my previous discussions with them and to write them a letter to get the issue resolved , i wrote the letter and guess what . . . still not resolved . i m livid . n nnot to mention that there was nothing about the minute consultation that i didn t already know , really didn t feel like there were any questions she asked me to learn about any concerns i might have , and i didn t receive any sort of benefit from this expensive , worthless lesson . i feel taken advantage of and upset about the entire situation .

0,"hello there ! n n u a u a u a my name is naiby moreno , and the reason why i m writing you this email is because last night , around this time , i was at your location in e . mckellips rd , mesa az , , and i placed an order for a few drinks where my bill came up to a little over . , unfortunately , i lost my receipt so , it s hard for me to give you the accurate information , however , i asked the cashier who took my order and realized later that it was the store mgr , if i could get my drinks in your reusable plastic cups , to what she said , no problem , it will be . each , so , i said , yes , that s fine . since i ordered some frappuccinos , the barista gave me some dome lids and told me , that they were giving me those covers because of the whipped cream , and he also said , but we ll give you the plastic lids on the side , we are just looking for them , so , i said , perfect ! , my kids and i sat down , and started drinking our drinks , waiting also to get our plastic covers , about minutes had passed by , and i saw the two baristas and the mgr , talking and brewing coffee , but nobody looking for any lids , so i went to the register and ordered an extra item which was a double chocolate chip brownie , so , the same blonde girl who was the mgr , took my order again , and i asked her if they had my lids for my cups , because we did need them , so , she gave me a sarcastic look and said , oh , i am looking for them , so , i said , ok , thanks . i went back to my chair and sat down again , and waited , and waited and waited , another to minutes had passed by , so , finally she came out and told us that they didn t have any lids for the cups , but that she was calling some stores to see if they could borrow some from them , so , i said , ok , by this time , i was already getting upset about the fact that she was almost ignoring me , because she didn t even say sorry , and it just seemed that she didn t care , u a and still i was trying to be nice and asked her if there was any other store around to where she could call and ask to give them to me , if it was on my way home , to what she replied , i am calling them , so , again , she went back inside , and again , i waited another minutes , finally she came back again holding one plastic lid and laughing she said , so , i only have one lid for your cups , but i there is this other store at mcdowell and power , and they have the other lids for you , you just have to go and get them . really ? ? ? , is that how you suppose to fix your problems , now , that and her careless attitude pissed me off , so , right after she said that to me i replied with a and you are the mgr , and she said yes , and i said , and you re sorry ? , because you never said sorry , so we started arguing when she said yes i did , and i said no you didn t . after this , i said , in my receipt says that i can get a refund if i don t want the items , and she said , fine i will give you a refund . i mentioned to her that i was a mgr at a coffee shop as well , and i knew about customer service standards , and i told her that what she was doing wasn t the right way of fixing a problem , to what she didn t like , i told her , you as a mgr , should know better that if you are out of plastic lids for your cups , you shouldn t even be selling them , or at least you need to let the customer know about the inconvenience . i asked my kids to finish their drinks because we were returning the cups that i had just purchased for them , because they had no lids for them , thus , we were not going to be able to use them to carry hot coffee , i went back to the register and gave your mgr the cups that she threw away in the trash can in front of me , splashing milk everywhere around , then she asked me if i was keeping the one cup with the lid , and i said well , yes , my other daughter went home already , so , i can t returned that one , so , after going back in the transaction in the system and refunded me for cups , she stated that my total was . then she said , my bad your total is actually less because i gave you u a . off each drink , again i said , ok , that was a discount on the drinks not on the cups , and she argued again and said yes , but thats how the system works , so , honestly and at that point i didn t care anymore of what she was doing or saying , i just told her whatever , just give me my money back , i just want to leave this place , so she did , then she made me sign a refund ticket , to proof the transaction , so i signed , and when i was leaving the location , i reminded her , to remove the cups from the display or to at least let her customer know about the inconvenience . n u a i am sorry , if i made this look like such a big deal , but coming from the management of food industry , i know my rights as a customer and i expect respect and good service , why , because i am paying for my product , i never asked for anything free , just some good service , obviously my question is what kind of service are your crew members suppose to give , when the mgr acts that way they won t care , right ?

0,"a friend raved about this place , so i was super excited . as someone who has traveled the country , my love for cupcakes is large n nthe cupcakes here were a disappointment . we bought half a dozen , all different flavors to get a feel for how they are . all the cupcakes were dry . . . nothing great at all . the frosting was grainy and left a greasy film from all the butter . n ni did give stars , only because of the cookies ! ! the cookies here are amazing ! ! ! ! they were delicious , i would recommend these over the cupcakes ! ! n ni will not go out of my way to come here , but if i am in the area i will get more cookies , no more cupcakes for me .

0,i ve given this place so many chances and it always lets me down . n nthe place looks cool and the live music is great . . but the food blows ! they need to revise the menu and focus on a few menu items and actually give them some flavor . the food always takes way too long tacos should not take longer than minutes and they are always cold . n nyayo blows ! 
0,ordered from the ayce menu and some of the salmon did not taste fresh . any roll that had cream cheese was over filled with it . i know great sushi and this place was sub par . maybe the smelly carpet and dive bar like atmosphere dampened my review . any suggestions as to where to get ayce sushi in the phoenix and outer phoenix areas would be great ! thank you
0,"generally , i love sonic . it is by far my favorite fast food restaurant . this one however , is the worst location i have ever eaten at . the food is extremely inconsistent . blasts are often not mixed through , so you end up getting plain vanilla towards the bottom . order extra items like extra brownie ? you may get it . . . or you may simply be charged for it but the amount they give you here is so minimal it just isn t worth it . i don t feel like paying for a single tiny brownie thrown in there . like shakes ? flip a coin . . . because sometimes you will get a shake you can sip with a straw , and other times you get another blast flavor . when you order cinnasnacks with cream cheese frosting , you shouldn t have to ask for cream cheese frosting separately . i ve seriously ordered a few times and didn t get it because i forgot to ask for it . n nthese are issues i don t have with other locations . i . . . just . . . don t . yet , this location is a short walk from my place , so i go for convenience . but i m not going to expect quality .

0,how does this location stay open ? lines are not that long and it takes forever to get up to the front to pay . there s always issues with the printers downstairs . i ve come here a few times and it s not good for my blood pressure . i went here once to get my resum u e copied on their paper and my printer had skewed the printing due north a bit . the dialogue at the counter went like this n nme can you move the print down ? n nher no . n nme you can just cut and paste on a new sheet of paper using whiteout tape . can you do that for me ? n nher no . n nme can you do anything ? n n a customer to my right starts laughing n ni wound up using the whiteout tape myself and made copies . then i had to wait in line minutes again just to pay . i was tempted to just walk out . other locations are way better .
